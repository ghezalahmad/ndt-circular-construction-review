Automated ultrasonic-based diagnosis of concrete compressive damage amidst temperature variations utilizing deep learning,Lei Wang; Shanchang Yi; Yang Yu; Chang Gao; Bijan Samali,2024,10.1016/j.ymssp.2024.111719,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing,"Ultrasonic-based non-destructive testing technologies have been extensively applied for detection of internal damage in concrete. However, it is vulnerable to environmental temperature variations. An automated ultrasonic-based diagnosis approach integrating the continuous wavelet transform, and the transfer learning enhanced deep convolutional neural networks is proposed to evaluate compressive damage amidst temperature variations. The ultrasonic tests were conducted on pre-damaged concrete specimens, considering both temperature variations and damage levels as variables. The results indicate that the temperature fluctuations significantly influence the ultrasonic parameters of concrete compression damage. The proposed method effectively identifies the concrete damage state amidst temperature variations. Furthermore, it is recommended that the temperature range within the training set should uniformly cover the expected temperature range throughout the lifespan of concrete structures.

Prediction of concrete compressive strength using support vector machine regression and non-destructive testing,Wanmao Zhang; Dunwen Liu; Kunpeng Cao,2024,10.1016/j.cscm.2024.e03416,Case Studies in Construction Materials,"Performance assessment of existing building structures, especially concrete compressive strength assessment, is a crucial aspect of engineering construction for most industrialized countries. Non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are commonly employed to assess the compressive strength of concrete structures. However, existing methods for predicting concrete compressive strength using NDT techniques and machine learning methods do not take into account the concrete mix proportion design. This study proposes an effective method to predict concrete compressive strength by combining NDT tests with different mix proportion designs and curing ages. Specifically, support vector machine regression (SVR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models are established. Furthermore, various machine learning evaluation indexes are utilized to assess the model performance. To construct and validate the prediction models, a total of 180 datasets containing concrete specimens with different mix proportion designs and curing ages are collected from the existing research literature. The prediction results show that the coefficients of determination (R2) of the SVR and the BPNN prediction models for the test set of concrete compressive strength are 86.0 % and 86.7 % without considering the concrete mix proportion design. The R2 of the prediction results of the SVR model is higher than 95 % when considering the effects of concrete mix proportion design and curing age. The R2 of the BPNN prediction model ranged between 92 % and 97 %. All the evaluation indexes of the SVR model for predicting the compressive strength of concrete are better than those of the BPNN model. Consequently, the SVR model can be utilized to accurately evaluate concrete compressive strength during the structural performance assessment of existing buildings.",33,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2024.e03416,https://openalex.org/W4399693758,Tasks: strength
Characteristics of non-steady-state chloride migration of self-compacting concrete containing recycled concrete aggregate made of fly ash and silica fume,Gritsada Sua-iam; Natt Makul,2024,10.1016/j.cscm.2024.e02877,Case Studies in Construction Materials,"Chloride migration poses a significant challenge to the long-term durability of concrete structures due to its potential to corrode reinforcement and deteriorate the structure. This study focuses on chloride migration in self-compacting concrete (SCC) made with pozzolans, namely silica fume (SF) and fly ash (FA), along with recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). Particularly, the effects of external electrical potential (power-on) duration and RCA content on the features of SCC were examined, alongside the influence of pozzolanic materials, focusing on the chloride migration coefficient and mechanical properties. Six groups of SCC mixtures were created with varying proportions of SF and FA, and different levels of RCA replaced the natural coarse aggregate. The findings reveal a multifaceted impact on SCC behaviour. The chloride migration coefficient exhibits a distinct pattern as the power-on duration increases from 12 to 36 h. Initially, the coefficient increases and then decreases, demonstrating a healing and sealing mechanism within the concrete matrix, which enhances resistance to chloride penetration. The chloride migration coefficient significantly decreased with adding SF and FA. With 15% SF and 30% FA, the coefficient decreased to 59.9% and 49.5%, respectively. Moreover, incorporating RCA in SCC mixtures significantly influences coefficient levels. RCA inclusion at 20% remarkably decreased the coefficient after 12 h by 16.17%. Subsequently, the levels decreased by 39.49% and 46.87% after 24 and 36 h, respectively, compared to the control mixture. This behaviour highlights the importance of RCA in enhancing the resistance of SCC to chloride ingress, a crucial factor for long-term durability. Additionally, mechanical properties such as splitting tensile strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity and surface hardness consistently improved with longer power-on durations and higher RCA and SF content. SCC with RCA and pozzolanic materials exhibits enhanced chloride resistance and superior mechanical performance, making it ideal for sustainable concrete production.",23,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2024.e02877,https://openalex.org/W4391074373,"Tasks: strength, deterioration"
Freeze–Thaw Damage Characteristics of Concrete Based on Compressive Mechanical Properties and Acoustic Parameters,Dongye Lv; Hanbing Liu; Feng He; Wensheng Wang; Qiang Miao,2024,10.3390/ma17051010,Materials,"Concrete is a versatile material widely used in modern construction. However, concrete is also subject to freeze–thaw damage, which can significantly reduce its mechanical properties and lead to premature failure. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the laboratory performance and freeze–thaw damage characteristics of a common mix proportion of concrete based on compressive mechanical tests and acoustic technologies. Freeze–thaw damage characteristics of the concrete were evaluated via compressive mechanical testing, mass loss analysis, and ultrasonic pulse velocity testing. Acoustic emission (AE) technology was utilized to assess the damage development status of the concrete. The outcomes indicated that the relationships between cumulative mass loss, compressive strength, and ultrasonic wave velocity and freeze–thaw cycles during the freezing–thawing process follow a parabola fitting pattern. As the freeze–thaw damage degree increased, the surface presented a trend of “smooth intact surface” to “surface with dense pores” to “cement mortar peeling” to “coarse aggregates exposed on a large area”. Therefore, there was a rapid decrease in the mass loss after a certain number of freeze–thaw cycles. According to the three stages divided by the stress–AE parameter curve, the linear growth stage shortens, the damage accumulation stage increases, and the failure stage appears earlier with the increase in freeze–thaw cycles. In conclusion, the application of a comprehensive understanding of freeze–thaw damage characteristics of concrete based on compressive properties and acoustic parameters would enhance the evaluation of the performance degradation and damage status for concrete structures.",22,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17051010,https://openalex.org/W4392044223,Tasks: strength
Nondestructive Testing (NDT) for Damage Detection in Concrete Elements with Externally Bonded Fiber-Reinforced Polymer,Jesus Ortiz Polanco; Seyed Saman Khedmatgozar Dolati; Pranit Malla; Armin Mehrabi; Antonio Nanni,2024,10.3390/buildings14010246,Buildings,"Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites offer a corrosion-resistant, lightweight, and durable alternative to traditional steel material in concrete structures. However, the lack of established inspection methods for assessing reinforced concrete elements with externally bonded FRP (EB-FRP) composites hinders industry-wide confidence in their adoption. This study addresses this gap by investigating non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques for detecting damage and defects in EB-FRP concrete elements. As such, this study first identified and categorized potential damage in EB-FRP concrete elements considering where and why they occur. The most promising NDT methods for detecting this damage were then analyzed. And lastly, experiments were carried out to assess the feasibility of the selected NDT methods for detecting these defects. The result of this study introduces infrared thermography (IR) as a proper method for identifying defects underneath the FRP system (wet lay-up). The IR was capable of highlighting defects as small as 625 mm2 (1 in.2) whether between layers (debonding) or between the substrate and FRP (delamination). It also indicates the inability of GPR to detect damage below the FRP laminates, while indicating the capability of PAU to detect concrete delamination and qualitatively identify bond damage in the FRP system.

Integrating Image Processing and Machine Learning for the Non-Destructive Assessment of RC Beams Damage,Hosein Naderpour; Mohammad Abbasi; Denise‐Penelope N. Kontoni; Masoomeh Mirrashid; Nima Ezami,2024,10.3390/buildings14010214,Buildings,"Non-destructive testing (NDT) is a crucial method for detecting damages in concrete structures. Structural damage can lead to functional changes, necessitating a range of damage detection techniques. Non-destructive methods enable the pinpointing of the location of the damage without causing harm to the structure, thus saving both time and money. Damaged structures exhibit alterations in their static and dynamic properties, primarily stemming from a reduction in stiffness. Monitoring these changes allows for the determination of the failure location and severity, facilitating timely repairs and reinforcement before further deterioration occurs. A systematic approach to damage detection and assessment is pivotal for fortifying structures and preventing structural collapse, which can result in both financial and human losses. In this study, we employ image processing to categorize damaged beams based on their crack growth and propagation patterns. We also utilize support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods to detect the type, location, and extent of failures in reinforced concrete beams.

Fiber reinforced concrete: a state of the art,Hogr Z. Hassan; Najmadeen Saeed,2024,10.1007/s43939-024-00171-w,Discover Materials,"Abstract Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is a type of concrete with added fibers that has become an interesting material for researchers to study its properties and behavior in a variety of scenarios. Fibers are long, thin, needlelike particles that are mixed into a typical cement paste, mortar, or concrete matrix. Researchers conducted various review studies on the use of fiber in concrete mixes to evaluate the changes in concrete properties. However, they had certain limitations because they only looked at one type of concrete or fiber, or how fiber influenced a restricted number of concrete properties. Others have decided to focus solely on recycled fibers, ignoring the effect of industrial fresh fibers on concrete. This work aims to develop an extensive database containing various types of fibers, fiber properties, fiber ratios, concrete mixtures, and aggregate particle varieties. The purpose of this database is to fill in the gaps and weaknesses of previous review papers and provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the literature produced by researchers studying fiber-reinforced concrete. The literature defined the effects of fibers in various kinds of use for different types of concrete. The study examines the impacts of fibers on the fifteen main features of concrete, employing 149 literatures that comprise its durability, workability, and mechanical capabilities. Compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, modules of elasticity, density, toughness, ultrasonic pulse velocity, slump, V funnel, L box, J ring, chloride penetration, air content, and electrical resistance are some of these topics. The results of each property were recorded from the literature and shown in graphs to make a clear comparison for different references which used various mix proportions, mix types, fiber dosages, and types, with aggregate types corresponding to mixture types. The fiber dosages for every literature were recorded in the database and the comparison in the graphs was made according to this fiber dosage. It is important to analysis the behavior of different concretes that contain various fiber types including different aggregates to understand the interaction of all these factors on concrete performance in the form of strength and workability, while looking for long-term behavior and durability. Moreover, understanding the materials behavior is important for leading researchers to further applications in structural concrete. According to the literature, essentially, the best technique to improve compressive strength is to increase the fiber content by up to 1%, and the most common and efficient type of fiber for this purpose is steel fiber. The tensile strength of concrete is greatly enhanced with the addition of fibers, which take the form of a web-like structure resembling a space truss. According to the sources that were examined, concrete’s flexural strength may be increased by up to 1.5% by adding more fiber. Flexural strength has enhanced by 50% to 70% or even more in the majority of investigations. The workability of the concrete has been negatively impacted by the fiber addition. Friction between the aggregates and the fibers provides a good explanation for the great majority of data, which are valid for nearly all types of fibers and concrete. Furthermore, this study investigates how fiber affects concrete durability in the presence of chloride penetration and discovers that adding additional fiber minimizes the amount of tensile and compressive strength loss. Most studies predicted increased concrete density, and the findings showed that high-fiber volume fraction combinations included more air than low-fiber volume fraction mixes.

However, there has been limited research on non-destructive testing (NDT) methods applicable for identifying damage in FRP-reinforced concrete (FRP-RC) elements. This knowledge gap has often limited its application in the construction industry. Engineers and owners often lack confidence in utilizing this relatively new construction material due to the challenge of assessing its condition. Thus, the main objective of this study is to determine the applicability of two of the most common NDT methods: the Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Phased Array Ultrasonic (PAU) methods for the detection of damage in FRP-RC elements. Three slab specimens with variations in FRP type (glass-, carbon- and basalt-FRP, i.e., GFRP, CFRP, and BFRP, respectively), bar diameter, bar depths, and defect types were investigated to determine the limitations and detection capabilities of these two NDT methods. The results show that GPR could detect damage in GFRP bars and CFRP strands, but PAU was limited to damage detection in CFRP strands.

Evaluation of Infrared Thermography Dataset for Delamination Detection in Reinforced Concrete Bridge Decks,Eberechi Ichi; Sattar Dorafshan,2024,10.3390/app14062455,Applied Sciences,"Structural health monitoring and condition assessment of existing bridge decks is a growing challenge. Conventional manned inspections are costly, labor-intensive, and often risky to execute. Sub-surface delamination, a leading cause of deck replacement, can be autonomously and objectively detected using infrared thermography (IRT) data with developed deep learning AI models to address some of the limitations associated with manned inspection. As one of the most promising classifiers, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have not been utilized to their fullest potential for delamination detection, arguably due to the scarcity of realistic ground truth datasets. In this study, a common encoder–decoder semantic segmentation-based DCNN is adapted through domain adaptation. The model was tuned and trained on a publicly available dataset to detect subsurface delamination in IRT data collected from in-service bridge decks. The authors investigated the effect of dataset augmentation, class imbalance, the number of classes, and the effect of background removal in the training dataset, resulting in an overall number of seventy-five UNET models. Four out of five bridges were adopted for training and validation, and the fifth bridge was for testing. Most models averaged 80 iterations, and the training progress finally reached a training accuracy of 75% with a loss of about 0.6 without any overfitting. The result showed a substantial difference in the minimum and maximum values for the evaluated performance metrics (0.447 and 0.773 for global accuracy, 0.494 and 0.657 for mean accuracy, 0.239 and 0.716 for precision, 0.243 and 0.558 for true positive rate (TPR), 0.529 and 0.899 for true negative rate (TNR), 0.282 and 0.550 for F1-score. The results also indicated that the models trained on the raw annotated balanced dataset performed best for half of the metrics. In contrast, the models trained on raw data (with no dataset enhancement) performed better when only global accuracy was considered.",12,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/app14062455,https://openalex.org/W4392851254,Tasks: defects

Early Detection of Corrosion Damage in Reinforced Concrete Using GPR Array Imaging Method,Weixia Cheng; Hai-Han Sun; Kang Hai Tan; Zheng Fan,2024,10.1109/tim.2024.3383496,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,"Corrosion of reinforcing bars constitutes a significant factor contributing to cracking and spalling in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. To prolong the service life of RC structures, it is crucial to develop a robust nondestructive inspection system for early-stage corrosion damage assessment. Although ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has proven its effectiveness in detecting severe corrosion damage, identifying early-stage corrosion with conventional GPR methods with single-input-single-output (SISO) configuration is challenging due to their limited sensitivity to subtle changes in the properties of the reinforcing bar and the surrounding environment. To address this challenge, this study introduces a method that employs a GPR array to increase sensitivity in detecting early-stage corrosion. The method uses a linear multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) GPR array to reconstruct images of the reinforcing bars during the corrosion process. The reconstructed images are highly sensitive to corrosion-induced rusts and cracks that exhibit different dielectric permittivity and conductivity compared to the concrete. By analyzing the differences in these images from those of bars in a healthy state using the structural similarity (SSIM) index, the progression of corrosion can be precisely identified. The effectiveness of this method has been validated through numerical simulations and experimental corrosion monitoring tests. Compared to conventional SISO GPR configurations, the MIMO array offers a broader perspective in sensing corrosion products surrounding the reinforcing bars, thereby improving sensitivity and robustness in detecting early-stage corrosion.",7,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1109/tim.2024.3383496,https://openalex.org/W4393379781,Tasks: deterioration
Design of Concrete Mock-Ups with Complex Defect Scenarios Using Numerical Simulations,Fabian Dethof; Sylvia Keßler,2024,10.1007/s10921-024-01074-9,Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation,"Abstract The major objective when applying non-destructive testing (NDT) in civil engineering is the detection of defects such as honeycombs. Defects can impair the service life of structures and could lead in the worst case to fatal failures. All structures such as bridges, tunnels, locks etc. are unique objects with variation in geometry, dimensions, materials, environmental condition, load scenarios etc. Thus, the interpretation of NDT data is challenging and the validation of the NDT method, the training of inspectors and the reliability analysis of NDT rely on mock-ups with known defect situations mimicking the type of defect as realistic as possible. The considered defect sizes inside the mock-ups should cover the transition zone between detectable and non-detectable to properly evaluate the capability of the inspection system. However, knowledge about the limits of an inspection system is mostly non-existent. To overcome this limitation, this study applies realistic numerical simulations for ultrasonic testing in reinforced concrete performed with the elastodynamic finite integration technique (EFIT) to identify this transition zone. First, the study shows the development and the validation of a numerical representation of concrete considering the implementation of a qualitatively realistic noise level. Additionally, the accurate representation of the sources during ultrasonic testing is confirmed by an investigation of the radiation characteristic for dry point contact ultrasonic transducers. The simulation outcome enabled the design of a mock-up, which explores the detection limits for honeycombs during ultrasonic testing under different boundary conditions.

The impact echo test was used for nondestructive testing, gathering data on compressive and shear wave velocity and frequency. The collected data, including compressive and shear wave velocity, frequency and derived material properties as well as modulus of elasticity, were used for subsequent analyses. To determine the type of defect, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods were utilized. Data collected from the impact echo method were analyzed using RStudio and the MATLAB toolbox for statistical analysis. Linear regression was employed to establish relationships between inputs (wave velocity and frequency) and outputs as shear and compressive modulus. The accuracy of these relationships was assessed through correlation coefficients, p-values and adjusted R-squared error. Additionally, an Imperial Competitive Algorithm (ICA) as part of the artificial neural network method was implemented to predict the variables. The results demonstrated high correlation coefficients and low mean square errors, indicating accurate predictions. Frequency domain defect detection was performed by analyzing frequency-amplitude data. The MATLAB toolbox was used to identify peaks and determine defects based on a 20% boundary condition.

Impact-Echo for Crack Detection in Concrete with Artificial Intelligence based on Supervised Deep Learning,Jeero Pandum; Kazuhito Hashimoto; Takafumi Sugiyama; Wanchai Yodsudjai; Hokkaido University,2024,10.58286/29925,e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing,"Aging concrete infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels need to be appropriately maintained in their service life because these structures must be employed with ensured safety level. Inspection and maintenance with reasonable measures are typically operated for the reinforced concrete before severe damage and failure are developed. Especially, the crack propagation in concrete can significantly affect the structural integrity, durability and overall performance of structural elements. Effective maintenance strategies are required for material and structural assessment with detection and repair of cracks to prevent further deterioration. Identification of cracks in concrete is effectively operated to extend the service life of structures for mitigating the potential safety hazards and minimize the repair costs. In order to detect the cracks in the concrete structure member, non-destructive testing (NDT) system can be often introduced to satisfy the technical issues in terms of damage evaluation and estimation of repair condition. Currently, various NDT methods have been utilized for quantitative analysis of internal damage/defects using elastic wave method such as impact-echo method, focusing on reflection of P-wave in concrete as wave propagation behavior. In experimental laboratory tests, concrete specimens are usually prepared with interior damages (cracks) which are simulated as embedded plastic plate or styrofoam. In this study, starch- type polysaccharide sheet is used to form the simulated cracks in concrete specimen. This study aims at applying impact-echo method with AI (Artificial Intelligence) to identify the internal crack information based on the waveform characteristics obtained from the elastic wave propagation behavior. The waveform results are converted to frequency spectrum by FFT analysis. Consequently, it is found in this study that AI, which is employed by supervised deep learning models, successfully evaluates the data and displays the probability of crack existence in concrete. Since FFT is a powerful algorithm that quickly converts a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, it gives efficient analysis to the impact echo method for crack detection with the application of AI system.",6,article,True,https://doi.org/10.58286/29925,https://openalex.org/W4398763217,"Tasks: deterioration, defects"

New Approach for Conditional Coring in RC Structures Using Bivariate Distributions of Nondestructive Test Results,Soubhagya Karmakar; Siddhartha Ghosh; Saha Dauji,2024,10.1061/ajrua6.rueng-1236,ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems Part A Civil Engineering,"Nondestructive tests (NDT) and partially destructive tests (PDT) are routinely employed for the management of aging infrastructure assets. Owing to the uncertainties in such NDT/PDT data, codes and guidelines recommend the fusion of multiple test results for making judicious inferences regarding the in-situ material properties. Researchers have proposed conditional coring to address the various constraints encountered in the costlier and damaging core tests (PDT). Conditional coring is the selection of core locations using the distribution of one NDT data (ultrasonic pulse velocity: UPV; or, rebound hammer: RH). This article first elucidates the limitations of such univariate approaches, providing a scientific basis for the variety of uncertainties typically present in RH and UPV data. Thereafter, a new approach for bivariate conditional coring is proposed to address these limitations. This method employs information from both RH and UPV to identify the PDT (e.g., core test) locations. The proposed method is validated against a variety of synthetic and real test data triads (RH-UPV-Core). It is concluded from the results that the bivariate method provides efficient and consistent estimates of the in-situ strength. These estimates are superior to those obtained from univariate approaches. This happens because of a better incorporation of the spatial variability in in-situ concrete strength and the measurement accuracy in NDT. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the number of PDTs can be reduced to achieve the same target accuracy as a univariate approach.

One component in overcoming this challenge is the evaluation of the reliability and the calculation of the remaining service life of existing structures. These structural reliability reassessments allow for the identification and utilization of load‐bearing capacity reserves. The consideration of actual structural characteristics and environmental conditions, various of which can be gathered by means of numerous measurement and inspection techniques, has the potential for more realistic computation results and therefore more economic decisions about the operation as well as maintenance activities. This article attempts to shed light on the potential of nondestructive testing (NDT) methods for updating the input variables in the ultimate limit states during a recalculation.

Mechanical Properties and Mesoscopic Numerical Simulation of Local Weakening in High-Performance Concrete after 10 Years of Alkali Solution Immersion,Juan Guo; Jianbo Guo; Hongfa Yu; Haiyan Ma; Jinhua Zhang,2024,10.3390/buildings14071965,Buildings,"The natural environment in the high-altitude regions of Northwest China is extremely harsh, characterized by numerous salt lakes. The high concentrations of chloride salts, sulfates, and alkali metal ions in these areas can induce alkali–silica reactions (ASRs) in concrete. These reactions generate harmful gel within the concrete, causing expansion and cracking, which significantly impacts the durability of concrete structures. This study investigates the evolution of the mechanical properties in high-performance concrete (HPC) under long-term ASR by incorporating different admixtures and varying the equivalent alkali content. A three-dimensional random aggregate mesoscopic model was used to simulate static compression tests under various operational conditions. Non-destructive testing methods were utilized to determine the expansion rate, internal, and surface damage variables of the concrete. The experimental results indicate that the 10-year expansion rate differs from the 1-year rate by approximately 1%, and under long-term ASR mitigation measures, the internal damage in the HPC is minimal, though the surface damage is more severe. As the equivalent alkali content increases, the compressive strength of the concrete cubes decreases, initially rising before falling by 5–15% over time. The HPC with only air-entraining agent added exhibited better mechanical performance than the HPC with both air-entraining and corrosion inhibitors added, with the poorest performance observed in the HPC with only a corrosion inhibitor. A relationship was established between the surface and internal damage variables, with the surface damage initially increasing rapidly before stabilizing as the internal damage rose. Numerical simulations effectively describe the damage behavior of HPC under static uniaxial compression. Comparisons with actual failure morphologies revealed that, in the cube compression tests, crack propagation directly penetrated both coarse and fine aggregates rather than circumventing them. The simulations closely matched the experimental outcomes, demonstrating their accuracy in modeling experiments. This study discusses the compressive mechanical properties of concrete under prolonged ASR through a combination of experimental and simulation approaches. It also delves into the impact of surface damage on the overall mechanical performance and failure modes of concrete. The findings provide experimental and simulation support for the concrete structures in regions with high alkali contents.",1,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14071965,https://openalex.org/W4400118353,"Tasks: strength, defects"

The electrochemical process of steel corrosion in concrete, influenced by factors like chloride or carbonation exposure and temperature, is discussed. The HCP method is a nondestructive technique for determining the corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in concrete structures. It involves measuring the potential difference between reinforcing steel and reference electrodes; typically, a copper/copper sulphate electrode is used. The potential difference between the two electrodes is then used to calculate the corrosion rate of the reinforcing steel. The HCP method is a reliable and cost-effective way to identify potential corrosion problems before they become severe. The present study used CorMap II® to measure HCP on the upstream face of the dam's drainage galleries.

Image Recognition of Concrete Electromagnetic Flaw Detection Based on Improved YOLOv7,Shuai Yuan; Ze Yuan; Kai He,2024,10.1145/3647649.3647675,,"Owing to the invisibility characteristics of the interiors of concrete structures, nondestructive testing technologies are commonly employed to detect internal damage. Electromagnetic flaw detection technology, as a prominent nondestructive testing method, offers capabilities of strong penetration and precise imaging. However, the output images produced by this detection technology are usually reliant on subjective human judgment, and existing automatic detection algorithms have limitations in terms of accuracy. To enhance the accuracy of electromagnetic flaw detection images, this paper proposes improved YOLOv7 based detection method. First of all, the ACBlock convolution module is introduced to replace the original 3×3 convolution kernel for alleviating the loss of edge feature information caused by the sampling operation of the backbone network MP module. Next, in order to have more focus on the semantic features of small targets, a global attention mechanism (GAMAttention) is incorporated into the algorithm. Then, the FReLU activation function is adopted to enhance the algorithm sensitivity to image space. Finally, experiments are conducted on a self-created concrete flaw detection image dataset to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the mean Average Precision (mAP) value achieved by the improved algorithm is 95.85%. which has a significant improvement of 13.89% in comparison with the pre-improved YOLOv7 algorithm and surpasses other algorithms in the same domain.

The aim of this paper is to investigate construction materials from 19th and 20th centuries and their mechanical and physical properties in a case study building from the conservation area of Võru city, South Estonia. Timber structures of the case study building were non-destructively tested on-site using a resistive method. Ceramic brick plinth and basement walls, as well as concrete and granite ceiling, were tested in situ non-destructively (rebound hammer test) for compressive strength estimation. Previously dismantled timber logs, slats and ceramic bricks were tested in the laboratory for compression and bending, respectively. The logs and slats matched the European timber bending strength classes C22 and C40, respectively. The compressive strength of the studied ceramic bricks was comparable to that of newly produced bricks. The non-destructive moisture content of timber structures varied in spring (5–20%) but was steady in the autumn (5–7%) tests. The rebound hammer test overestimated by 1.5…2 times the compressive strength of the studied materials compared to laboratory tests.",0,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113565,https://openalex.org/W4404283454,"Tasks: strength, moisture"

Mechanical performance of fiber-reinforced concrete and functionally graded concrete with natural and recycled aggregates,Sabireen; Faheem Butt; Afnan Ahmad; Kiffayat Ullah; Osama Zaid,2023,10.1016/j.asej.2023.102121,Ain Shams Engineering Journal,"This study aims to assess the mechanical performance of functionally graded concrete (FGC) in comparison to conventional plain cement concrete (PCC) and fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC). For this purpose, five concrete mixes were prepared, defined in eleven patterns, including PCC as a control mix, two FRC mixes, and eight combinations for FGC mixes. The hooked-end steel fibres and recycled thin polyethylene terephthalate (PET) strips from used bottles were utilized as fibres in 0.75 % of the volume of the mix in the FRC and FGC mixes. The natural aggregates were replaced by 15 % by weight with recycled plastic aggregates (RPA) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) in the FGC mixes. The mechanical performance of all specimens was assessed by compressive, split tensile and flexural strength tests, whereas the concrete quality was evaluated by the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test. The results revealed that the FRC mix containing steel fibres has 50.6 % higher compressive strength, while PET-FRC exhibited 42.4 % lower strength than the PCC. The best combination of the FGC mix is RCA + SFRC (H), which showed 27.6 % more compressive strength than PCC. The steel fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) mix has the highest split tensile strength, which is 47.5 % higher than the PCC. The best combination of FGC mixes is SFRC + PET-FRC (J), yielding 29.3 % higher tensile strength than PCC. On the other hand, both fibres contribute to the flexural strength enhancement of FRC. The FGC mix (K) yielded the highest flexural strength, with PET-FRC and SFRC in the upper and bottom layers, respectively, giving 40 % more flexural strength than the PCC specimen. The UPV values depicted that fibres and recycled aggregates in FGC specimens enhanced the quality of concrete. The highest value of UPV was recorded in the mix PCC + SFRC (G) containing PCC and steel fibres, which almost reached the upper limit of the recommended UPV values.",57,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asej.2023.102121,https://openalex.org/W4315645803,Tasks: strength

Development of a Reliable Machine Learning Model to Predict Compressive Strength of FRP-Confined Concrete Cylinders,Prashant Kumar; Harish Chandra Arora; Alireza Bahrami; Aman Kumar; Krishna Kumar,2023,10.3390/buildings13040931,Buildings,"The degradation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures has raised major concerns in the concrete industry. The demolition of existing structures has shown to be an unsustainable solution and leads to many financial concerns. Alternatively, the strengthening sector has put forward many sustainable solutions, such as the retrofitting and rehabilitation of existing structural elements with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Over the past four decades, FRP retrofits have attracted major attention from the scientific community, thanks to their numerous advantages such as having less weight, being non-corrodible, etc., that help enhance the axial, flexural, and shear capacities of RC members. This study focuses on predicting the compressive strength (CS) of FRP-confined concrete cylinders using analytical models and machine learning (ML) models. To achieve this, a total of 1151 specimens of cylinders have been amassed from comprehensive literature studies. The ML models utilized in the study are Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), optimized SVM, and optimized GPR models. The input parameters that have been used for prediction include the geometrical characteristics of specimens, the mechanical properties of FRP composite, and the CS of concrete. The results of the five ML models are compared with nineteen analytical models. The results evaluated from the ML algorithms imply that the optimized GPR model has been found to be the best among all other models, demonstrating a higher correlation coefficient, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error, a-20 index, and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency values of 0.9960, 3.88 MPa, 3.11%, 2.17 MPa, 0.9895, and 0.9921, respectively.

Defect Detection in CFRP Concrete Reinforcement Using the Microwave Infrared Thermography (MIRT) Method—A Numerical Modeling and Experimental Approach,Sam Ang Keo; Barbara Szymanik; Claire Le Roy; Franck Brachelet; Didier Defer,2023,10.3390/app13148393,Applied Sciences,"This research paper presents the application of the microwave infrared thermography (MIRT) technique for the purpose of detecting and characterizing defects in the carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite reinforcement of concrete specimens. Initially, a numerical model was constructed, which consisted of a broadband pyramidal horn antenna and the specimen. The present study investigated the application of a 360 W power system that operated at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, specifically focusing on two different operational modes: continuous and modulated. The specimen being examined consisted of a solid concrete slab that was coated with an adhesive layer, which was then overlaid with a layer of CFRP. Within the adhesive layer, at the interface between the concrete and CFRP, there was a defect in the form of an air gap. The study examined three distinct scenarios: a sample without any defects, a sample with a defect positioned at the center, and a sample with a defect positioned outside the center. The subsequent stage of the investigation incorporated experimental verification of the numerical modeling results. The experiment involved the utilization of two concrete specimens reinforced using CFRP, one without any defects and the other with a defect. Numerical modeling was used in this study to analyze the phenomenon of microwave heating in complex structures. The objective was to evaluate the selected antenna geometry and determine the optimal experimental configuration. Subsequently, these findings were experimentally validated. The observations conducted during the heating phase were particularly noteworthy, as they differed from previous studies that only performed observation of the sample after the heating phase. The results show that MIRT has the potential to be utilized as a method for identifying defects in concrete structures that are reinforced with CFRP.",19,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/app13148393,https://openalex.org/W4384929768,Tasks: defects
Diagnosis of durability-related problems in concrete structures through comprehensive analysis and non-destructive testing: a case study,Mati Ullah Shah; Muhammad Usman; Rao Arsalan Khushnood; Asad Hanif,2023,10.1080/24705314.2023.2233812,Journal of Structural Integrity and Maintenance,"The present study investigated concrete durability problems at the National University of Sciences and Technology,Pakistan, through comprehensive analysis and non-destructive testing. During the visual inspection of concrete structures, different deterioration mechanisms such as alkali-silica aggregate reaction (ASR), carbonation, abrasion and drying shrinkage were found. After visual inspection, the data on ingredients used in the construction of various structures were collected, revealingthat different brands of cement used in construction contained high alkali-equivalent content. Fine aggregates were used from two different quarries during construction. The available literature and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) results showed that both the quarries' aggregates have the potential for alkali-silica reactivity. Furthermore, the XRD results of gel-type material collected from mapped cracking indicated the presence of delhayelite, similar to alkali-silica gel, suggesting ASR. The XRD curves of the whitest powder collected from various sites showed the presence of sodium sulfate and calcium carbonate peaks, indicating salt hydration attacks. The carbonation rate in concrete ranges from 4.33 to 5.77 mm/year. The results of the rebound hammer and pulse velocity test indicated that concrete used in parking has low strength which is the main cause of abrasion.

Furthermore, understanding the exceptional durability performance of ultra-high-performance concrete can minimize environmental impacts and retrofitting costs associated with structures. This study presents a systematic experimental investigation of eco-friendly ultra-high-performance self-compacting basalt fiber (BF)-reinforced concrete by incorporating waste nanomaterials, namely nano-wheat straw ash (NWSA), nano-sesame stalk ash (NSSA), and nano-cotton stalk ash (NCSA), as partial substitutes for Portland cement. The research evaluates the effects of varying dosages of nanomaterials (ranging from 5 to 15% as cement replacements) in the presence of BFs. Rheological properties were analyzed, including flow diameter, L-box, and V-funnel tests. Additionally, the study investigated compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural strengths, load-displacement behavior, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and durability performance of the ultra-high-performance self-compacting basalt fiber (BF)-reinforced concrete (UHPSCFRC) samples subjected to sulfate attack, freeze-thaw cycles, autogenous shrinkage, and exposure to temperatures of 150, 300, 450, and 600°C. Microstructural characteristics of the mixtures were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The findings reveal that self-compacting properties can be achieved in the UHPSCFRC by incorporating NWSA, NSSA, and NCSA. The presence of 10% NWSA significantly improved the mechanical properties of the UHPSCFRC, exhibiting more than 27.55% increase in compressive strength, 17.36% increase in splitting tensile strength, and 21.5% increase in flexural strength compared to the control sample. The UHPSCFRC sample with 10% NWSA demonstrated superior performance across all extreme durability tests, surpassing both the control and other modified samples.

Computational Intelligence-Based Structural Health Monitoring of Corroded and Eccentrically Loaded Reinforced Concrete Columns,Somain Sharma; Harish Chandra Arora; Aman Kumar; Denise‐Penelope N. Kontoni; Nishant Raj Kapoor,2023,10.1155/2023/9715120,Shock and Vibration,"Corrosion of embedded steel reinforcement is the prime influencing factor that deteriorates the structural performance and reduces the serviceability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures, especially during earthquakes. In structural elements, RC columns play a vital role in transferring the superstructure’s load to the substructure. The deterioration of RC columns can affect the structures’ overall performance. Hence, it becomes essential to estimate the remaining life of deteriorated RC columns. In the literature, only limited analytical models are available to calculate the remaining life of corroded and eccentrically loaded RC columns. As the number of dependent parameters increases, assessing the residual life of the structural elements and providing a practically applicable suitable model become very complex. Machine learning (ML)-based prediction models are beneficial in dealing with such complex databases. In this article, an ML-based artificial neural network (ANN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms have been applied to estimate the residual strength of corroded and eccentrically loaded RC columns. The performance of the analytical and ML models is accessed using commonly used performance indices, namely, the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), a-20 index, and Nash–Sutcliffe (NS). The results of the proposed ANN model have been compared with the existing analytical model to identify the suitability of the best model. Based on performance analysis, the precision of the GPR and SVM models is lower than that of the ANN model. The processed results revealed that the R2 value of the ANN model for training, testing, and validation datasets is 0.9908, 0.9757, and 0.9855, respectively. The MAPE, MAE, RMSE, NS, and a-20 index for all the datasets are 8.31%, 48.35 kN, 72.53 kN, 0.9886, and 0.8978, respectively. The precision of the ANN model in terms of the coefficient of determination is 225.77% higher than that of the analytical model. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the compressive strength of concrete plays the most significant role in the load-carrying capacity of corroded and eccentrically loaded RC columns. The proposed ANN model is reliable, accurate, fast, and cost effective. This model can also be used as a structural health-monitoring tool to detect the early damages in the RC columns.",13,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9715120,https://openalex.org/W4321434577,Tasks: strength
Evaluation of Reinforced Concrete Structures with Magnetic Method and ACO (Amplitude-Correlation-Offset) Decomposition,Paweł Karol Frankowski; Tomasz Chady,2023,10.3390/ma16165589,Materials,"The magnetic method is one of the very few nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques that provide the possibility to conduct area tests of reinforced concrete (RC) structures in a fast, cheap, and straightforward way. This paper aims to present a new approach to the simultaneous identification of rebars’ diameter, alloy class, and thickness of the concrete cover tested with this method. Since rebars from different manufacturers may have different electromagnetic properties (standardization only for mechanical properties), preparing an effective and universal database is impossible. In this work, ACO decomposition is proposed, a new attributes extraction method designed to identify object parameters, even if it is impossible to collect a suitable training database (by pattern recognition and analysis of the deviation). Conducted tests prove that the ACO method enables accurate reflection of the waveform shape and limitation of attributes number to three or fewer (avoiding the curse of dimensionality). These properties, combined with the ability to analyze spatial components of magnetic induction (which only magnetic sensors provide), make the complex task of identification of three parameters more straightforward and the separation between the results received for different classes larger.

Machine learning (ML) has been recently applied to the IE signal classification problem. However, because of the scarcity of labeled IE datasets, most existing work relies on relatively small training and test datasets without addressing the generalizability and transferability of the developed models. In this paper, we compare two approaches for automatic classification of IE signals: clustering based on expert-crafted features and deep learning (DL) from automatically extracted features. Next, we use the knowledge gained from a DL model trained on concrete specimens with available ground truth to make predictions about defects in a different specimen with completely different construction and characteristics (transfer learning). Finally, we examine our DL model to gain insights into the model working (explainability) and highlight the attributions that are significant in classifying a particular IE signal.

Finally, the timber defect detection accuracy and Betula timber yield are analyzed, and the comprehensive utilization value of optimized sawing timber is compared with the comprehensive utilization value of manually marking sawing timber. The processing cost and efficiency of Betula sawing timber with an intelligent automatic production line are calculated. The test results show that the average detection accuracy of timber defect type, size and location is 89.69%, 89.69%, 92.25% and 82.29%, respectively, and the detection stability is high.

Automatic Rebar Picking for Corrosion Assessment of RC Bridge Decks with Ground-Penetrating Radar Data,Yu‐Chen Zhang; Yanliang Du; Ting‐Hua Yi; Songhan Zhang,2023,10.1061/jpcfev.cfeng-4591,Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities,"The detection and evaluation of internal corrosion of concrete bridge decks is of critical importance for bridge structure safety. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a nondestructive testing technique that has been used widely for corrosion assessment of RC bridge decks. However, the recognition accuracy of traditional automatic data processing methods for blurred hyperbolic features is insufficient, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of bridge deck corrosion assessment. To address this problem, this paper proposes an automatic rebar picking algorithm based on gradient information and a migration method for bridge deck corrosion assessment with GPR data. This method can be divided into three steps: thresholding processing based on B-scan gradient information, a limited hyperbolic summation-based recognition (LHSR) algorithm, and rebar localization. First, the GPR B-scan is transformed into its gradient image and thresholded to enhance hyperbolic features. The LHSR algorithm then is applied to the binarized gradient B-scan to identify the hyperbolas, locate the rebar, and extract the rebar reflection amplitude. Finally, the corrosion map of the bridge deck is generated based on the rebar position and the rebar reflection amplitude after depth-correction. A case study with GPR data from two tested bridges was employed to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The results show that the precision and recall of automatic rebar picking by this method for poor-quality GPR data were 91.27% and 93.56%, which are significantly higher than those of the traditional methods. Moreover, the accuracy of the bridge deck corrosion map obtained by the proposed method also is significantly better than that of the traditional methods. It can be concluded that the proposed method can be used for rebar picking and corrosion assessment of RC bridge decks with GPR data.",10,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1061/jpcfev.cfeng-4591,https://openalex.org/W4390242434,Tasks: deterioration

The present research investigates the potential of corrosion inhibitors to enhance the durability and strength of concrete structures, with a focus on their long-term effectiveness in resisting corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. Multiple approaches such as inhibitors, repairing processes, and coatings have been explored to prevent concrete corrosion damage, with an emphasis on concrete corrosion performance in coastal and corrosive situations. This study investigates the effect of six different corrosion inhibitors (zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, urea, sodium nitrate, sodium molybdate, and diethyl ether) on the compressive strength and durability of concrete samples. The compressive strength is assessed using both destructive (28 days cube compressive strength) and non-destructive (Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity) test methods, while concrete durability is evaluated using the rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT). The compressive strength of the admixture incorporated samples are found to be higher than the control sample by almost 50% and above with excellent concrete quality. The RCPT values of inhibitor-incorporated samples are moderate and low with control samples having high permeability even in adverse conditions of freezing, thawing, and deicing. The samples incorporated with inhibitors also show less negative half-cell potential which is 1.43 times less than that of the control sample indicating the lesser probability of occurrence of corrosion. SEM imaging is also conducted to analyze the microstructure of each mix.

Specimens are subjected to various environmental exposure such as elevated temperature, acidic, alkaline and sea water conditions. Two varieties of epoxy viz. neat epoxy and MWCNT modified epoxy systems are considered. Mechanical and durability properties are analyzed based on axial compressive behavior, stress strain response, visual inspection and modes of failure. The MWCNT incorporated epoxy based hybrid FRP confined specimens exhibited a strength reduction less than 10% when compared with unexposed confined specimens under aggressive environmental conditions, while unconfined specimens showed strength reduction by 40% when compared to unexposed unconfined specimens. The MWCNT modified epoxy based hybrid confinement showed an energy absorption of 6.24 times that of unconfined specimens upon chemical exposure. Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity test revealed efficacy of confinement system in protecting concrete core from a sudden failure, which in turn increases the compressive strength of system.

Development of a New Nondestructive Method for the In-Situ Determination of Mortar Strength,Jiří Žalský; Miroslav Vokáč; Milan Hrabánek; Karel Hurtig,2023,10.3390/buildings13020273,Buildings,"The determination of the load bearing capacity of masonry in existing structures is not an easy task, even for experienced surveyors. For its assessment, it is necessary to know the compressive strength of the masonry units and mortar. Relatively good destructive and non-destructive methods were developed for the determination of the compressive strength of masonry units. However, mortar compressive strength determination is currently closer to a rough estimation rather than a deterministic approach. All of the currently used methods are either complicated, have a limited application, or are based on the surveyor’s experience only. Influence of the human factor on the results of testing is significant. The paper introduces the development of a new non-destructive method, which eliminates the influence of the human factor. The method is supposed to work as quickly and as easily as the Schmidt hammer used for concrete structure surveys. The new instrument was created where the compressive strength of mortar is assessed by hammering a steel bar into a joint with constant energy, while the depth of penetration is measured. The impact energy is provided by a steel spring with a prescribed stiffness, and the loading is provided by an automatic system similar to those used in air-soft guns.",10,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings13020273,https://openalex.org/W4317042584,Tasks: strength
Experimental Evaluation of Shape Memory Alloy Retrofitting Effect for Circular Concrete Column Using Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity,Taemin Lee; Saebyeok Jeong; Ukyong Woo; Hajin Choi; Donghyuk Jung,2023,10.1186/s40069-022-00574-0,International Journal of Concrete Structures and Materials,"Abstract The seismic performance of a concrete column retrofitted with an iron-based shape memory alloy (Fe-SMA) was evaluated under cyclic loading. In addition to structural behavior, internal damage was monitored using an ultrasonic pulse velocity test. The round shapes of three reinforced concrete (RC) columns were tested: a non-retrofitted RC column as a control, a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) column, and an Fe-SMA retrofitted column. During the cyclic loading test, the degradation of the column was defined based on the decrease in compressional wave velocities. The experimental results demonstrated a maximum improvement of 175% in seismic performance of the Fe-SMA retrofitted RC column compared with the controlled column. This is primarily owing to the active constraints of the SMA, which were quantified based on ultrasonic velocities. Furthermore, the surface degradation process was identified using external cracks, which were not visible in the CFRP retrofitted RC column.",9,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40069-022-00574-0,https://openalex.org/W4321605357,Tasks: defects

Of particular interest was to determine which of the observed parameters the GPR is most sensitive to. Furthermore, particular emphasis was placed on understanding the influence of corrosion products, which has not met the consensus in the existing literature.

Research on the Rebound Hammer Testing of High-Strength Concrete’s Compressive Strength in the Xinjiang Region,Jinming Chen; Qiang Jin; Baoli Dong; Cun Dong,2023,10.3390/buildings13122905,Buildings,"Enhancing the assessment of compressive strength and the efficiency of rebound hammers in non-destructive testing for high-strength concrete is an urgent issue in construction engineering. This study involved C50 to C90 high-strength concrete specimens, utilizing rebound hammers with nominal energies of 4.5 J and 5.5 J, along with a compression machine. A regression analysis was performed on the compressive strength and rebound values, resulting in linear, polynomial, power, exponential, and logarithmic equations for two different types of rebound hammers. Additionally, the precision of rebound hammers with different nominal energies and the representativeness of various rebound representative values in the measurement area were investigated. The experimental results indicate that the precision of the regionally representative strength curve in Xinjiang meets national specifications. The 4.5 J nominal energy rebound hammer exhibited a higher testing accuracy. When reducing the high-strength concrete measurement area’s rebound representative values from 16 to 14, 12, and 10, the coefficients of variation for the different rebound representative values were mostly below 10%. Within high-strength concrete structures, the strength curve formula derived from rebound representative value 16 is equally applicable to 14, 12, and 10. In practical engineering applications, prioritizing 10 ensures testing accuracy while reducing on-site testing efforts.

Therefore, special concrete demand to respond to crack formation with its self-healing action leads to microbial concrete research and development. In this study, the effects of bacterial utilization on both mechanical/physical properties of the recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) containing mortar mixtures and the crack-healing were investigated. Bacillus subtilis bacteria were cultivated on three different nutrient media, Tryptic Soy Broth, Modify Luria-Bertani, and urea-calcium phosphate, and then encapsulated in RCA with these nutrient media. Twenty-one different mortar mixtures were prepared by partially replacement of bacterial RCA with the limestone one. The compressive and flexural strengths as well as ultrasonic pulse velocity of mortar mixtures were determined. Also, physical properties of the mortar mixtures such water absorption, capillarity and total void ratio were obtained. It was observed that the physical and mechanical properties of the mortar mixtures containing less than 30% RCA are significantly healed by CaCO 3 precipitated by bacteria. The results showed that that urea and Ca 2+ in the nutrient media increase the CaCO 3 precipitation efficiency of bacteria, but glucose in the media causes foaming in the mixtures and creates a hollow structure. The study also indicated that microorganisms had a positive role not only in the concrete strength increasing but also in facilitating the self-healing of cracks.

One major characteristic of these degradation processes is their multiphasic nature; consequently, they can be discretised into different phases with specific physical kinematics where specific maintenance actions and measurement techniques can be performed. Within this framework, we propose implementing a degradation meta-modelling approach fed with measurements (NDT, SHM).

Applicability of available NDT methods for damage detection in concrete elements reinforced or strengthened with FRP,Pranit Malla; Seyed Saman Khedmatgozar Dolati; Armin Mehrabi; Jesus Ortiz Polanco; Antonio Nanni,2023,10.3233/brs-230217,Bridge Structures,"The application of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials in concrete structures has been rising due to their several advantages, including lightweight, high tensile strength, ease of installation, and corrosion resistance. They have been mostly implemented for strengthening and repairing existing structures in the form of an externally bonded system, i.e., sheet, jacket, near surface mounted. Furthermore, they have been recently utilized as internal reinforcement of concrete elements in the form of strands, bars, tendons, etc. Although higher durability and performance are associated with the FRP material in some aspects compared to steel, concerns remain regarding damages and defects in this material, many of which are related to their unique features. Importantly, debonding of FRP materials from a concrete surface or within a concrete element has always been an issue resulting in the premature failure of the structure. To this end, concrete elements strengthened or reinforced with FRP materials has to be inspected periodically to detect potential issues and hence prevent any premature failures. This study first determines all possible or potential damages and anomalies attributed to FRP reinforced/strengthened concrete (FRP-RSC) elements. It then investigates Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods that can be applicable to the inspection of FRP-RSC elements from a literature survey of past studies, applications, and research projects. Furthermore, this study evaluates the ability of two of the most commonly used NDT methods, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Phased Array Ultrasonic (PAU), in detecting FRP bars/strands embedded in concrete elements. GPR and PAU tests were performed on two slab specimens reinforced with GFRP (Glass-FRP) bars, the most commonly used FRP bar, with variations in their depth, size and configuration, and a slab specimen with different types of available FRP reinforcements. The results of this study propose the most applicable methods for detecting FRP and their damage/defects in FRP-RSC elements. This study further investigates the feasibility of two new methods for improving the detectability of embedded FRP bars. By providing the inspection community with more clarity in the application of NDT to FRP, this study offers means for verifying the performance and, therefore, help the proliferation of FRP materials in concrete structures.",6,article,False,https://doi.org/10.3233/brs-230217,https://openalex.org/W4389947029,"Tasks: strength, defects"

With the expeditious growth in the construction industry, the rate of demolition has also increased. This is causing considerable increase in Construction and Demolition (C&amp;D) waste all around the globe. To minimize its impact on society and environment, preventive measures are required to be taken on urgent basis, and for this reason construction industry has proposed the use of recycle concrete aggregates in different applications and there is dire need to investigate experimentally the properties of concrete products made using Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC). In this regard, this study focused to investigate the mechanical properties of 100% RAC bricks prepared with two different compositions with respect to coarse to fine aggregates ratio (i.e., 70:30 and 60:40), cement dosage (i.e., 10% and 15% by weight of total aggregates) and casting pressure (i.e., 25 MPa and 35 MPa). Recycled concrete aggregates required for this study were produced by crushing tested concrete samples having compressive strength of 21 MPa to 28 MPa. Mechanical tests were performed on bricks to determine their compressive strength, flexural strength, shear strength, impact energy in compression and flexure. In addition to these destructive tests, non-destructive (rebound hammer and ultra-sonic pulse velocity) tests were also performed. To draft a comparison, Natural Aggregate Concrete (NAC) bricks and first class burnt clay bricks were also tested. The results indicated that the compressive strength of NAC bricks was about 30% higher than the compressive strength of RAC bricks. However, RAC bricks exhibited higher compressive strength as compared to burnt-clay bricks. The flexural strength of RAC bricks containing 60% coarse aggregates and 40% fine aggregates and RAC bricks containing 70% coarse aggregates and 30% fine aggregates was found to be almost similar but their flexure strength was 37.3% and 20.7% lesser than their corresponding NAC bricks. Flexure strength of RAC bricks and burnt clay bricks was found to be almost same. Qualitative assessment by ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) tests showed that the NAC and RAC bricks were of good quality as per the standard criteria. The findings of this study indicated that RAC bricks satisfied the strength requirements as stated by local and international standards. Further, RAC bricks performed better than commonly used first class burnt clay bricks.

This study aimed to determine the original building state and deterioration by applying non-destructive testing (NDT) methods in the case of a heritage building. Another goal was to determine, via NDT methods, whether the limestones observed in this study of different forms, colours, and textures were truly different. The Sivas Industry School Ironworking Atelier, which constitutes the research object, is one of the important public buildings in the city of Sivas, Turkey. Within the scope of the study, non-destructive infrared thermography (IRT), Schmidt hammer rebound (SHR) tests, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy were applied. Accordingly, through IRT, deteriorations, anomalies, and material differences were investigated, and via SHR testing, uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) estimates, strength levels and hardness classes of stones were obtained. Moreover, via XRF spectroscopy, characterization analysis of stones was conducted. The data obtained could provide information to establish a basis for subsequent conservation. The innovation of this study is that although the infrared thermography technique is typically used in the investigation of materials, it was revealed that another technique such as XRF analysis is needed to better determine whether stones that seem different based on IRT are actually different. With IRT technique, anomaly and material detorioration can be determined. In addition to these two techniques, SHR tests that are non-destructive methods are needed to think about mechanical features of the material. Therefore, when determining the conditions and for characterization analysis of a cultural heritage before restoration, different techniques should be jointly used to complement each other.",5,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40494-023-00889-5,https://openalex.org/W4360991108,Tasks: strength

For most applications of Impact Echo however, only the resonance frequency of the measured time signal is evaluated, meaning that most information is neglected. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of machine learning can help to classify signals based on multiple input parameters and therefore make use of the additional information stored in the measured signals. As the most powerful classification models need labelled input data, this usually marks a problem since labelled NDT data sets are rarely available for concrete structures. One solution to overcome this problem is the use of numerical simulations. In the past, numerical simulations showed that they are capable to produce realistic synthetic data for Impact Echo testing in concrete specimens. In this study, numerical simulations of Impact Echo measurements were conducted using the Elastodynamic Finite Integration technique (EFIT) to create training data for machine learning models. The measurements were carried out on two concrete specimens (17 cm and 50 cm thickness) containing honeycombs. Using the simulation data, multi-layer perceptron (MLPNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are trained and tested on measured data from each specimen for performance.

Furthermore, the crest-to-trough behavior on the B<sub>z</sub> signal curve and its zero-point gradient spacing can more accurately indicate the corroded area's extent. Then, a magnetic characteristic parameter W based on a large amount of experimental data was established to characterize the degree of corrosion of the steel bars. The magnetic characteristic parameter W is linearly related to the maximum cross-sectional area loss rate η of the corroded reinforcement.

Changes in use, increasing loads, and—especially in transport infrastructure— sharply rising traffic flows are encountering an infrastructure that has largely reached or exceeded its service life. During the entire lifecycle of structures and materials, the engineer needs to decide which action(s) are optimal, e.g., most eco-efficient at what time. This decision-making process is based on the reassessment of the structure or network, which depends substantially on the information available about the system. It is well known that available and continuously further developed NDT methods allow the collection of manifold information highly relevant in structural assessment. However, the condition (i.e., the quality) of the information measured on-site and the reliability of inspection systems need to be known before NDT results can be used in such safety-relevant calculations. This contribution attempts to shed light on the application of POD analyses and measurement uncertainty calculations in nondestructive testing of concrete structures to provide useful and quality-assured information for reliability assessments of our built environment—with an emphasis on ground penetrating radar. It is shown that signal processing techniques affect POD analysis results to varying degrees, that measurement uncertainties are useful to validate PODs, and that the utilization of both POD analysis and measurement uncertainty calculations can pave the way to NDT-based reliability assessment, which will be exemplarily demonstrated in conclusion—generally aiming to derive those maintenance strategies and actions that are in line with actual demands.",3,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2658736,https://openalex.org/W4366977237,Tasks: deterioration

It is intended here to access the potential use of UPV testing in the monitoring of anomalies related to the degradation of building facades due, particularly, to cracking and to water penetration associated with WDR (wind driven-rain). The preliminary assessment of the use of UPV testing is made through the previous analysis of the results of the application of UPV testing for the detection of sub-surface and surface cracking in compression tests of masonry specimens. Following that analysis, an evaluation is made of the conditioning aspects of the use of UPV testing to access durability problems of the building envelope. Particularly, the main characteristics of cracking with interest for the assessment of the potential use of UPV testing are generally discussed. And, finally, an evaluation is made of the risk of water penetration through the cracks, for potential use of UPV testing in monitoring the presence of humidity in the cracks.",2,article,True,https://doi.org/10.37394/232015.2023.19.87,https://openalex.org/W4386928026,Tasks: deterioration
Automatic Identification Method of Defects in Concrete Structures Strengthened with Composite Materials Based on a Multi-Scale Model,Xiaoming Lu; Xinyan Lin,2023,10.3390/coatings13122005,Coatings,"Due to the inconsistent geometric characteristics of reinforced concrete structures with composite materials, some echo signals have a lower degree of clarity, resulting in problems such as long time, small range, and low accuracy in identifying structural defects. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of defect identification in composite material reinforced concrete structures, a multi-scale model based on the automatic defect identification method for composite material reinforced concrete structures is proposed. Using the interface connection method, based on continuous distribution coupling and the uniform weighting coefficient calculation method to weigh the interface nodes, we determined the interface connection mode and analyzed the stress–strain relationship. The impact echo method was used to analyze the degree of high-frequency stress wave scattering caused by internal non-uniformity in composite reinforced concrete, and the fast Fourier transform conversion algorithm was used to generate amplitude–frequency curves and resolved thickness or defect depth. The experimental results show that the multi-scale finite element simulation structure of this method is clear and accurate, and although there are errors, they do not affect the simulation results of the structure. The impact echo detection effect is obvious; it can automatically identify defects in composite reinforced concrete structures and quickly and accurately identify defects in different states and positions of composite reinforced concrete, with a recognition accuracy of 98%.",2,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings13122005,https://openalex.org/W4389049784,Tasks: defects
Void Detection inside Duct of Prestressed Concrete Bridges Based on Deep Support Vector Data Description,Byoung-Doo Oh; Hyung Woo Choi; Won-Jong Chin; Chan-Young Park; Yu-Seop Kim,2023,10.3390/app13105981,Applied Sciences,"The tendon that is inserted into the duct is a crucial component of prestressed concrete (PSC) bridges and, when exposed to air, can quickly corrode, and cause structural collapse. It can interpret the signal measured by non-destructive testing (NDT) to determine the condition (normal or void) inside the duct. However, it requires the use of expensive NDT equipment such as ultrasonic waves or the hiring of experts. In this paper, we proposed an impact–echo (IE) method based on deep support vector data description (Deep SVDD) for economical void detection inside a duct. Because the pattern of IE changes for various reasons such as difference of specimen or bridge, supervised learning is not suitable. Deep SVDD is classified as normal and defective, which is a broad distribution as a hypersphere that encloses a multi-dimensional feature space for normal data represented by an autoencoder. Here, an autoencoder was developed based on the ELMo (embeddings from language model)-like structure to obtain an effective representation for IE. In the experiment, we evaluated the performance of the IE data measured in different specimens. Thus, our proposed model showed an accuracy of about 77.84% which is an improvement of up to about 47% compared to the supervised learning approach.",2,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/app13105981,https://openalex.org/W4376274497,Tasks: defects

The multimodal and dispersion phenomena are the primary challenges in the use of guided wave technology for engineering applications. Currently, plate, thin-walled tube, and rod structures—where multimodality and dispersion are comparatively mild and simple to control—remain the major applications of guided wave technology. For more complicated civil engineering structures, severe multimodal and dispersion phenomena cause more difficult issues. The present work began with the study of round-faced reinforced concrete. The waveguide propagation characteristics are computationally analyzed with the assistance of theoretical calculation methods and sweeping frequency simulation experiments. These analytical tools are then creatively applied to threaded reinforced concrete, and the dispersion characteristics of this complex, axially periodically varying waveguide are successfully analyzed. The phenomenon of frequency band pass/stop is also discussed. In addition, this research provides ideas for nondestructive testing and inverse imaging in this field by means of deep learning of the interface debonding defect characteristics of reinforced concrete with the help of convolutional neural networks.

Assessment of Existing Masonry Resistance Using Partial Factors Approaches and Field Measurements,Luka Lulić; Ivan Lukačević; Davor Skejić; Mislav Stepinac,2023,10.3390/buildings13112790,Buildings,"The vast majority of existing structures in Croatia, as well as in other European countries, are made of unreinforced masonry. The seemingly ideal building material presents a great challenge for engineers in earthquake-prone zones. Given that structural failure can have significant consequences in terms of loss of human lives as well as financial losses, a comprehensive structural reliability assessment is needed. Old existing masonry structures often do not have design documentation, and even when they do, the initial mechanical properties have almost certainly degraded over time. That is why in situ testing is of great importance, but masonry is also characterized by a large scattering of results. After recent severe earthquakes in Croatia, more than ever, there is a need for a more reliable assessment of existing masonry structures. This paper presents reliability approaches for resistance evaluation of existing masonry in a real case study where basic failure modes of the masonry were observed. First, the data recommended in standards were used, followed by the updated data obtained from the flat-jack test. Finally, the design value method (DVM) and the adjusted partial factor method (APFM) were used. These methods align with Eurocode standards for new structures but are also adaptable for the assessment of existing structures. Differences in the results between the existing and the new version of the standard were observed, as well as an increase in the obtained resistances with an increase in the complexity of the methods used.

The study was designed as 30 measurements, each with 200 data. The examination of the data sets obtained from FMCW radar revealed the presence of amplitude distortion and frequency shift in the response signals of the clean and corroded metal objects. Results show that corrosion on a metal object can be effectively detected by FMCW radar, which is being developed as an NDT device.

Once placed at its final position this cavity is filled with freshly cast and compacted concrete. Aside from benefits such as increased ease in installation, reduced cost and shorter construction time also some pitfalls are recognized. Due to the restrained space and the presence of the truss girder undesired defects (e.g. voids, honeycombing, etc.) might occur without being noticed, as the outer wall elements also act as formwork. This actually might reduce the load capacity and jeopardize the structural integrity of the concrete structure. Therefore, different non-destructive tests are being used in order to assess the filling degree of the cavity in the double walls and to localize defects, with varying success ratio (i.e. the detectability). Different techniques were applied on a test wall with intentionally embedded defects (polystyrene blocks) with varying diameter: rebound hammer, ultrasonic pulse velocity via direct transmission, ultrasonic shear-wave tomography, ground penetrating radar and active infrared thermography.

All-important properties of concrete such as flowability, compressive, flexural, tensile strength and modulus of elasticity were presented in this review article. Furthermore, durability aspects such as chloride ion penetration, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and acid resistance were also considered. Finally, the bond strength of the fiber and cement paste was examined via scanning electron microscopy. Results indicate that glass fibers improved concrete’s strength and durability but decreased the concrete’s flowability. Higher glass fiber doses slightly decreased the mechanical performance of concrete due to lack of workability. The typical optimum dose is recommended at 2.0%.

Compressive Strength Prediction of Lightweight Concrete: Machine Learning Models,Aman Kumar; Harish Chandra Arora; Nishant Raj Kapoor; Mazin Abed Mohammed; Krishna Kumar,2022,10.3390/su14042404,Sustainability,"Concrete is the most commonly used construction material. The physical properties of concrete vary with the type of concrete, such as high and ultra-high-strength concrete, fibre-reinforced concrete, polymer-modified concrete, and lightweight concrete. The precise prediction of the properties of concrete is a problem due to the design code, which typically requires specific characteristics. The emergence of a new category of technology has motivated researchers to develop mechanical strength prediction models using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Empirical and statistical models have been extensively used. These models require a huge amount of laboratory data and still provide inaccurate results. Sometimes, these models cannot predict the properties of concrete due to complexity in the concrete mix design and curing conditions. To conquer such issues, AI models have been introduced as another approach for predicting the compressive strength and other properties of concrete. This article discusses machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian Progress Regression (GPR), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR), Ensemble Learning (EL), and optimized GPR, SVMR, and EL, to predict the compressive strength of Lightweight Concrete (LWC). The simulation approaches of these trained models indicate that AI can provide accurate prediction models without undertaking extensive laboratory trials. Each model’s applicability and performance were rigorously reviewed and assessed. The findings revealed that the optimized GPR model (R = 0.9803) used in this study had the greatest accuracy. In addition, the optimized SVMR and GPR model showed good performance, with R-values 0.9777 and 0.9740, respectively.

Second, the fiber reinforcement mechanisms and anisotropy characteristics of PFRC were analyzed by nondestructive ultrasonic pulse velocity tests, destructive mechanical property tests, and scanning electron microscope tests. Third, the correlation between mechanical properties and ultrasonic signals was analyzed, and the conversion criteria were further established. Moreover, the application range of conversion criteria was also determined. The test results showed that the optimum dosage of PVA fibers is 0.5 wt% for 3D printing FRPC, and the highest cube compressive strength and flexural strength are 98.2 MPa and 6.8 MPa, respectively. The mechanical properties and acoustics of 3D printed specimens showed significant anisotropy.

Comparative Evaluation of Sisal and Polypropylene Fiber Reinforced Concrete Properties,Samantha Acosta-Calderon; Pablo Gordillo-Silva; Natividad García-Troncoso; D.V. Bompa; Jorge Flores-Rada,2022,10.3390/fib10040031,Fibers,"This paper presents a focused comparative case study considering the influence of natural and synthetic fibers on the fresh and mechanical properties of concrete. Locally sourced 19 mm long sisal fibers from sisalana leaves and manufactured polypropylene fibers were incorporated in a normal strength concrete matrix with fiber volumetric contents of 1%. After describing the measured aggregate characteristics, mix designs, and fresh concrete properties, several destructive and non-destructive tests on hardened concrete were undertaken. The former included compression tests on cylinders and flexural tests on prismatic samples, and the latter included ultrasonic pulse velocity and rebound number tests. The workability of sisal-fiber reinforced concrete was generally lower than the nominal concrete and that provided with polypropylene fibers by about 20%, largely due to the hydrophilic nature of the natural fibers. Test results showed that the presence of sisal fibers can improve the compressive strength by about 6%, and the tensile strength by about 4%, compared with the non-reinforced counterpart. This was due to the sisal fibers storing moisture that was released gradually during hydration, helping with the strength development. The concrete with polypropylene had virtually identical properties to the reference concrete. In addition to fresh and mechanical properties, environmental impacts associated with the production of fiber and concrete were also identified and discussed. Based on the assessments from this paper, overall, from the two fibers investigated, the sisal fiber showed more promising results, indicating that natural fibers can be a more sustainable alternative to plastic fibers, providing a good balance between workability and strengths.",43,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/fib10040031,https://openalex.org/W4220774985,Tasks: strength
Destructive and Non-Destructive Testing of the Performance of Copper Slag Fiber-Reinforced Concrete,Vijayaprabha Chakrawarthi; Brindha Dharmar; Siva Avudaiappan; Mugahed Amran; Erick Saavedra Flores,2022,10.3390/ma15134536,Materials,"Concrete technology is adopted worldwide in construction due to its effectiveness, performance, and price benefits. Subsequently, it needs to be an eco-friendly, sustainable, and energy-efficient material. This is achieved by replacing or adding energy-efficient concrete materials from industries, such as ground granulated blast furnace slag, steel slag, fly ash, bottom ash, rice husk ash, etc. Likewise, copper slag is a waste material produced as molten slag from the copper industry, which can be used in concrete production. Copper slag can perform roles similar to pozzolans in the hydration process. This paper extends the comparative study of copper slag concrete with polypropylene fiber (PPF) subjected to destructive and non-destructive testing. Under destructive testing, compressive strength of concrete cubes, compressive strength of mortar cubes, splitting tensile tests on cylindrical specimens, and flexural tests on plain cement concrete were conducted and analysed. Ultrasonic pulse velocity and rebound hammer tests were performed on the samples as per IS13311-Part 1-1992 for non-destructive testing. The 100% replacement of copper slag exhibited a very high workability of 105 mm, while the addition of 0.8% PPF decreased the flowability of the concrete. Hence, the workability of concrete decreases as the fiber content increases. The density of the concrete was found to be increased in the range of 5% to 10%. Furthermore, it was found that, for all volume fractions of fiber, there was no reduction in compressive strength of up to 80% of copper slag concrete compared to control concrete. The 40% copper slag concrete was the best mix proportion for increasing compressive strength. However, for cement mortar applications, 80% copper slag is recommended. The findings of non-destructive testing show that, except for 100% copper slag, all mixes were of good quality compared to other mixes. Linear relationships were developed to predict compressive strength from UPV and rebound hammer test values. This relationship shows better prediction among dependent and independent values. It is concluded that copper slag has a pozzolanic composition, and is compatible with PPF, resulting in good mechanical characteristics.",29,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15134536,https://openalex.org/W4283709607,Tasks: strength
Study on electrochemical characteristics of reinforced concrete corrosion under the action of carbonation and chloride,Kanze Mei; Zhimin He; Bing Yi; Xinyuan Lin; Jianmin Wang,2022,10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01351,Case Studies in Construction Materials,"Considering parameters of corrosion area ratio and mass loss degree, the half-cell potential method and linear polarization method were applied to study the corrosion state of steel bars under the influence of carbonation, chloride salt and compound environmental action. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure steel corrosion under coupling action and the effect of sodium nitrite rust inhibitor in the compound environment was studied. The results show that the corrosion rate of steel under carbonation, chloride salt and compound environment increases in the beginning and then decreases. In the chloride environment, sufficient moisture inside the concrete at the initial stage of curing induces a faster corroding. With the destruction of the passive film on the surface of the steel bars together with the balance of internal and external humidity, the corrosion rate tends to stabilize. At the following curing stage, the corrosion rate decreases as the degree of steel corrosion increases and the corrosion layer is formed. Carbonation reduces the alkalinity around the passive film and damages the passive film, which accelerates the corrosion happening. The following development of the corrosion layer of steel bars limits the corrosion rate. The corrosion degree in the compound environment is more serious than that under the condition of single factor action. Under electrochemical action, the order of product components resulting from steel corrosion are Fe2O3, Fe3+-Ca2SiO4 and FeO from high to low. Nitrite oxidizes the unstable Fe2+ into stable Fe3+ and precipitates on the surface of the steel to form a passivation film, which has a good anti-rust effect.",29,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01351,https://openalex.org/W4288046998,Tasks: deterioration
Evaluation of Void Defects behind Tunnel Lining through GPR forward Simulation,Xianlong Wu; Xiaohua Bao; Jun Shen; Xiangsheng Chen; Hongzhi Cui,2022,10.3390/s22249702,Sensors,"Voids, a common defect in tunnel construction, lead to the deterioration of the lining structure and reduce the safety of tunnels. In this study, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was used in tunnel lining void detection. Based on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, a forward model was established to simulate the process of tunnel lining void detection. The area of the forward image and the actual void area was analyzed based on the binarization method. Both the plain concrete and reinforced concrete lining with various sizes of air-filled and water-filled voids were considered. The rationality of the model was verified by measured data. It was observed that the response mode of voids can be hyperbolic, bowl-shaped, and strip-shaped, and this depends on the void’s width. Compared with the air-filled voids, water filling increases the response range of the voids and produces a virtual image. Although the diffracted wave caused by a steel bar will bring about significant interference to the void response, the center position of the voids can be accurately located using 3D GPR.",27,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22249702,https://openalex.org/W4311153851,Tasks: defects

Most defect datasets contain visual images of surface defects; however, subsurface defect data such as delamination which are critical for effective bridge deck evaluations are typically rare or limited to laboratory specimens. Three Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods (Infrared Thermography (IRT), Impact Echo (IE), and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)) were used for concrete delamination detection and reinforcement corrosion detection. The authors have developed a unique NDE dataset, Structural Defect Network 2021 (SDNET2021), which consists of IRT, IE, and GPR data collected from five in-service reinforced concrete bridge decks. A delamination survey map locating the areas, extent and classes of delamination served as the ground truth for annotating IRT, IE and GPR field tests’ data in this study. The IRT were processed to create an ortho-mosaic maps for each deck and were aligned with the ground truth maps using image registration, affine transformation, image binarization, morphological operations, connected components and region props techniques to execute a semi-automatic pixel–wise annotation. Conventional methods such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT)/peak frequency and B-Scan were used for preliminary analysis for the IE and GPR signal data respectively. The quality of NDE data was verified using conventional Image Quality Assessment (IQA) techniques. SDNET2021 dataset consists of 557 delaminated and 1379 sound IE signals, 214,943 delaminated and 448,159 sound GPR signals, and about 1,718,083 delaminated and 2,862,597 sound IRT pixels.

Experimental evaluation of heat transition mechanism in concrete with subsurface defects using infrared thermography,Masoud Pedram; Susan Taylor; G. A. Hamill; Desmond Robinson; Eugene J. OBrien,2022,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.129531,Construction and Building Materials,"Concrete is a highly consumed construction material used in the built environment and civil infrastructure. Therefore, condition monitoring using non-destructive techniques such as infrared thermography (IRT) should be optimised to extend the safe and continuous operation of existing structural asset and to reduce the requirement for new construction, which is more carbon intensive. The objective of this paper is to present an in-depth understanding of the heat flow mechanism in concrete slabs with hidden subsurface defects using IRT experiments. The experiments were performed on six concrete slabs with dimensions of 250 × 250 × 100 mm. Five of these slabs had 5 to 25 mm concrete cover over the simulated subsurface defect, and the sixth slab was plain concrete with no defect, used as control sample. Two sets of experiments using step heating thermography (SHT) technique were conducted using an IR heater as the excitation mechanism. By thermography of slabs, several sequences of IR images were recorded during both heating and cooling phases. Subsequently, the sequences of IR images were post-processed using a routine developed in MATLAB to achieve the evolution of temperature on surface of the samples. The temperature records from the tests during both heating and cooling phases were used to calculate thermal contrast, as well as first and second time derivatives of thermal contrast. By close examination of the sequences of IR images as well as sign analysis of the thermal contrast and its time derivatives, the mechanism of heat transition in defective concretes was characterised and interpreted in three stages during both heating and cooling phases. The three stages of heating phase are named as simultaneous heat-up, lateral heat flow and maximum thermal contrast. The formation of the lateral heat flow that corresponds to the transition from stage one to two causes the thermal gradient on the surface observable by the thermal camera. Likewise, three stages of cooling phase are simultaneous cool down, lateral heat diffusion from void cover to sound concrete and inverse thermal contrast. The conclusions of this study increase the basic understanding about mechanism of heat transfer in defective concrete and put forward new directions toward optimised implementation of IRT for the detection of hidden defects in concrete bridges.",26,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.129531,https://openalex.org/W4308742342,Tasks: geometry
Destructive and Non-Destructive Evaluation of Fibre-Reinforced Concrete: A Comprehensive Study of Mechanical Properties,‎Hadee Mohammed Najm; Ominda Nanayakkara; Mohanad Muayad Sabri Sabri,2022,10.3390/ma15134432,Materials,"Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and rebound hammer tests are accepted as alternatives to destructive testing to determine the compressive strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, and Poisson’s ratio, which are needed for structural design. Although much work has been conducted for plain concrete, the research data for fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) is insufficient. In this regard, this study explains the correlations between compressive strength, rebound hammer, and UPV tests for plain concrete and FRC contains 0.25%, 0.50%, and 1.00% of 30 mm and 50 mm long steel fibres. A total of 78 concrete cube and beam specimens were tested by direct, semi-direct, and indirect UPV and rebound hammer test methods. The study found that the rebound hammer test is more suitable for measuring the compressive strength of matured FRC than young concrete. The UPV test revealed that the volume fraction does not, but the length of steel fibres does affect the UPV results by the direct test method. The UPV direct method has the highest velocity, approximately two times the indirect velocity in FRC. UPV measurements can be effectively used to determine the dynamic modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio of FRC. The dynamic elastic modulus increases while the Poisson’s ratio decreases for the same steel fibre length when at increasing FRC fibre content. The results of this study will be significant for non-destructive evaluations of FRC, while additional recommendations for future studies are presented at the end of the paper.",21,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15134432,https://openalex.org/W4283361567,Tasks: strength

Diagnosis of internal cracks in concrete using vibro-acoustic modulation and machine learning,Sarah Miele; Pranav Karve; Sankaran Mahadevan; Vivek Agarwal,2022,10.1177/14759217211047901,Structural Health Monitoring,"This paper investigates the utility of physics-informed machine learning models for vibro-acoustic modulation (VAM)–based damage localization in concrete structures. Vibro-acoustic modulation is a nonlinear dynamics-based non-destructive testing method, which was initially developed to perform damage detection and later extended to accomplish damage localization. The VAM-based damage (hidden crack) diagnosis is performed by analyzing the damage index pattern on the surface of the component to arrive at the size and location of the hidden damage. Past investigations have employed heuristically selected damage index thresholds as well as computationally expensive Bayesian estimation methods for VAM-based damage localization in two (surface) dimensions. Compared to these studies, the proposed methodology automates the threshold selection (algorithmic instead of heuristic), increases the speed of the probabilistic damage diagnosis process, and enables the estimation of damage depth. We generate training data (damage index) for the machine learning models using the pertinent nonlinear dynamics (finite element) models using different combinations of test parameters. The (supervised) machine learning models are thus informed by computational physics models. These include two types of artificial neural network (ANN) models: classification models that identify whether a sensor location is damaged or not and regression models that enable Bayesian estimation to obtain the posterior probability distribution of damage location and size. The accuracy of machine learning-based diagnosis is evaluated using both numerical and laboratory experiments. The proposed physics-informed machine learning models for VAM-based damage diagnosis are able to achieve an accuracy of about 60–64% in the validation experiments, indicating the potential of these methods for internal crack detection. The results show that for complex (nonlinear dynamics-driven) diagnostic methods, damage index patterns learned from physics models could be successfully used for damage detection as well as localization.",14,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1177/14759217211047901,https://openalex.org/W4206544469,Tasks: defects
A Multi-Path Encoder Network for GPR Data Inversion to Improve Defect Detection in Reinforced Concrete,Yuanzheng Wang; Hui Qin; Miao Feng,2022,10.3390/rs14225871,Remote Sensing,"Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been extensively used in the routine inspection of reinforced concrete structures. However, the signatures in GPR images are reflected electromagnetic waves rather than their actual shapes. The interpretation of GPR data is a mandatory but time- and labor-consuming task. Furthermore, the rebars in the near-surface of concrete cause clutter in the GPR images, which hinders the interpretation of GPR data. This work presents a deep learning network to invert GPR B-scan images to permittivity maps of subsurface structures. The proposed network has a multi-path encoder which enables the network to leverage three kinds of GPR data: the original, migrated, and encoder–decoder-processed GPR data. Each type of processing method is designed to serve a different purpose: the original GPR images retain all the waveforms; the migration method intensifies the vertices of the subsurface anomalies; the encoder–decoder network suppresses rebar clutter and enhances the visibility of the defect echoes. The outputs of three processing methods are jointly used to interpret GPR B-scan images. We demonstrated the superiority of the proposed network by comparing it with a network with a single-path encoder. We also validated the proposed network with synthetic and experimental GPR data.

Nonetheless, uncertainty in what forms of bridge deck deterioration each NDT method can identify has posed challenges in best deploying NDT methods for deck condition assessments. Thus, in this study, a full-scale 18 ft by 31 ft reinforced concrete bridge was constructed with defects in the deck simulating reinforcing steel corrosion, delaminations, concrete deterioration, voids, and poorly constructed concrete. The deck was evaluated with ground-penetrating radar, infrared thermography, and impact-echo nondestructive technologies to evaluate their potential for defect detection. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was implemented to quantify the capability of a given NDT method to detect a particular defect. Conclusions concerning which forms of concrete bridge deck deterioration each NDT method can detect were developed. It was found that of the three NDT methods considered, impact-echo testing was the most effective to evaluate the condition of bridge decks.

The Application of Two-Dimensional Continuous Wavelet Transform Based on Active Infrared Thermography for Subsurface Defect Detection in Concrete Structures,Ali K. Saleh; Zafer I. Sakka; Hasan Almuhanna,2022,10.3390/buildings12111967,Buildings,"The early condition-based assessment of civil infrastructures plays an essential role in extending their service life, preventing undesirable sudden failures, and reducing maintenance and rehabilitation costs. One of the most commonly used and fastest nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques is infrared thermography (IRT), which has emerged as a powerful method for assessing general concrete quality and detecting subsurface damage in structural members. Nevertheless, the accurate detection and classification of localized defects is still a challenging task to achieve. The contribution made by enhancing defect detection using two-dimensional (2D) wavelet transformation (WT) as a post-processing method, however, has received little attention within the field of active IR thermography. In this study, we explored the use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to visualize how the wavelet function at different frequencies could enhance the damage features of thermal images. A concrete slab under an applied heat flux was tested experimentally by an IR camera with well-controlled excitation sources. The qualitative visualization of thermograms was translated into quantitative results by extracting, processing, and post-processing the values assigned to the pixels in the thermal images. With the assumption of there being no oriented damage features, an isotropic (non-directional) Mexican hat wavelet was utilized as the mother wavelet. The experimental results showed that the 2D-CWT method achieved strong detection performance in extracting discriminatory features (defective areas) from the acquired thermal images. Compared with raw thermograms, the resultant CWT-transformed images were less affected by the non-uniform heating effect, and the boundaries of the defects contrasted more strongly. The 2D-CWT method demonstrates good sensitivity when an appropriate wavelet type and scale factor are chosen. Due to the desire to detect localized defects, adjusting the scale factor of the wavelet is important to improve the efficiency of detection as lower scale factors provide the finer details of thermal images, whereas higher scale factors provide the general outline of internal defects. The findings of this study represent a further step toward improving thermographic data for more precise defect-detection imaging, and principally for large concrete structures, that can be verified easily using other NDT surveys.",13,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12111967,https://openalex.org/W4308972074,"Tasks: deterioration, defects"

The present research was conducted to evaluate five time-dependent parameters from several different tests, namely compressive strength, static modulus, dynamic modulus, surface, and bulk electrical resistance. Some parameters were obtained using destructive testing (DT) and some using non-destructive testing (NDT). Due to the correlation and calculation of regression curves, it was possible to compare the correlation of parameters important for estimating the durability of reinforced concrete structures in relation to degradation and corrosion. Concrete of C40/50 grade was examined in several time periods, and the parameter relationships were analysed. At the same time, a statistical evaluation was carried out, and therefore the study contains the average values and standard deviations of all measured parameters. The results show that the compressive strength and the electrical resistivity of the surface and bulk have a high correlation. In contrast, the dynamic modulus and electrical resistivity have low linear correlation, but it was possible to apply a quadratic curve with a high degree of fit. For the comparison of static elastic modulus and electrical resistance, the quality of the quadratic regression model was low but sufficient.

The current study investigated the feasibility of using the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test as a non-destructive technique to assess the quality of both new and old bricks in masonry structures. A relationship was developed after performing the UPV test followed by a compression test on burnt clay brick samples of five different ages acquired from different sources. The acquired brick samples ranged from new to a century old. Consequently, as a novel contribution, brick quality assessment criteria based on UPV were proposed according to which a UPV value greater than 3000 m/s represents an excellent first-class brick whereas a UPV value lower than 2000 m/s shows a second-class brick. Further, the effectiveness of the UPV test to assess the compressive strength of old bricks was demonstrated with a case study of a 100-year-old masonry structure.

The axial compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, Mohr–Coulomb failure envelopes of the mortar are determined over a range of conditions. Mortar specimens were prepared with a water to cementitious material ratio ( w / cm ) of 0.6–0.7 and were tested at curing ages of 3, 7, 14, and 28 days, under confining pressures of 0, 100, 250, 500 and 750 kPa. Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of the specimens were measured before the destructive testing. The results indicate that the influence of curing age and confining pressure on the axial compressive strength of the mortar can be predicted using proposed linear correlations between (i) The confining pressure and the axial compressive strength and (ii) The UPV and the axial compressive strength. From the test results, the strength parameters of the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion were also determined. It is observed that cohesion is more sensitive to changes in curing age and w / cm than the friction angle, which varied between 32 and 33 degrees.",12,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1617/s11527-022-01959-z,https://openalex.org/W4223993408,Tasks: strength
Comparison between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Autonomous Delamination Detection Using Impact Echo,Faezeh Jafari; Sattar Dorafshan,2022,10.3390/rs14246307,Remote Sensing,"Impact echo (IE) is a non-destructive evaluation method commonly used to detect subsurface delamination in reinforced concrete bridge decks. Existing analysis methods are based on frequency domain which can lead to inaccurate assessments of reinforced concrete bridge decks since they do not consider features of the IE signals in the time domain. The authors propose a new method for IE classification by combining features in the time and the frequency domains. The features used in this study included normalized peak values, energy, power, time of peaks, and signal lengths that were extracted from IE signals after they are preprocessed. We used a dataset containing IE data collected from four in-service bridges, annotated using chain dragging. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed using combined features to classify IE signals. A 1DCNN with unfiltered IE signals and a two-dimensional CNN using wavelet scalograms (2D representations of unfiltered IE signals) were also used to classify IE signals. The SVM model performed significantly better than the other models, with an accuracy rate, true positive rate, and true negative rate of 97%, 92%, and 98%, respectively. The SVM model also generated more accurate defect maps for all investigated bridges. IE data from the Federal Highway Administration’s InfoBridge website were used to investigate the efficacy of the developed models. The investigation yielded promising results for the proposed SVM model when used for a new set of IE data.",11,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14246307,https://openalex.org/W4311363867,Tasks: defects
Non-Destructive Multi-Method Assessment of Steel Fiber Orientation in Concrete,Sabine Kruschwitz; Tyler Oesch; Frank Mielentz; Dietmar Meinel; Panagiotis Spyridis,2022,10.3390/app12020697,Applied Sciences,"Integration of fiber reinforcement in high-performance cementitious materials has become widely applied in many fields of construction. One of the most investigated advantages of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) is the deceleration of crack growth and hence its improved sustainability. Additional benefits are associated with its structural properties, as fibers can significantly increase the ductility and the tensile strength of concrete. In some applications it is even possible to entirely replace the conventional reinforcement, leading to significant logistical and environmental benefits. Fiber reinforcement can, however, have critical disadvantages and even hinder the performance of concrete, since it can induce an anisotropic material behavior of the mixture if the fibers are not appropriately oriented. For a safe use of SFRC in the future, reliable non-destructive testing (NDT) methods need to be identified to assess the fibers’ orientation in hardened concrete. In this study, ultrasonic material testing, electrical impedance testing, and X-ray computed tomography have been investigated for this purpose using specially produced samples with biased or random fiber orientations. We demonstrate the capabilities of each of these NDT techniques for fiber orientation measurements and draw conclusions based on these results about the most promising areas for future research and development.",11,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/app12020697,https://openalex.org/W4206482424,Tasks: strength

Bond behavior in pull-out of a ribbed rebar from concrete with recycled concrete aggregates,Orit Leibovich; David Z. Yankelevsky,2022,10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01607,Case Studies in Construction Materials,"In recent years, there is a worldwide growing interest in using concrete mixes with recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). Reinforced concrete is the composite of concrete and steel rebars, where the rebars provide relatively higher tensile strength and ductility, energy absorption capacity, and crack control. This composite action depends on the interfacial bond between the rebar and the concrete. The bond behavior is commonly evaluated from pull-out test results which yield the global relationship between the average bond-stress and the corresponding slip and depend on the concrete properties and the rebar geometry. The present study investigates the bond behavior in concrete with RCA in comparison to concrete with natural aggregates aiming at short bond lengths to obtain the local bond-slip behavior. Two major complementary aspects of the bond behavior in the longitudinal (bond stress-slip) and circumferential directions (circumferential strain-slip) are studied, and the post-test interior damage is investigated. The study found that the magnitudes of the maximum bond stress are not affected by the aggregate type and are in accordance with the concrete compressive strength, but different internal damage mechanisms develop in the specimens of the two aggregate types. The different internal damage mechanisms in RCA specimens affect the internal confinement level's development and the circumferential strains' magnitude, which are considerably different than in concrete with natural aggregates.",9,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01607,https://openalex.org/W4308742990,"Tasks: strength, defects"

In the following study, a 2D numerical model of the pull-out test is presented in order to study the impact of corrosion on the bond strength. Several parameters are investigated: the embedment depth, the rebar’s diameter, and the width of the concrete cover. The model reproduces the slip of the rebar and the failure through the splitting of concrete. It integrates an interface between the two materials and a concrete damage model that simulate the deterioration of concrete in compression and tension. The results obtained are validated with experimental data from the literature. Moreover, a parametric study is carried out to determine the impact of the embedment depth, the diameter of the rebar, and the concrete cover on the bond strength. The present study confirms that a greater embedment depth increases the pulling load.

Utilizing Polypropylene Fiber in Sustainable Structural Concrete Mixtures,Saman Hedjazi; Daniel Castillo,2022,10.3390/civileng3030033,CivilEng,"Polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC) is becoming more popular for structural purposes due to its durability, electrical resistivity, and mechanical properties. In this study, the influence of polypropylene fiber on the mechanical properties and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) were determined. Six different fiber volume fractions of polypropylene were considered in the experimental investigation with varying water–cement ratios and curing conditions. Non-destructive testing methods were utilized to determine the UPV of the PFRC. Available equations in literature for predicting the RFC’s compressive strength based on UPV values were selected. However, the computed values did not show good agreement with the compressive strengths obtained from the compression testing machine. It was confirmed that polypropylene fibers alter the propagation of UPV, and as a result, the existing equations do not accurately predict the compressive strength for PFRC.

Spatial variability of half-cell potential data from a reinforced concrete structure—a geostatistical analysis,Patrick Pfändler; Sylvia Keßler; Maximilian Huber; Ueli Angst,2022,10.1080/15732479.2022.2158204,Structure and Infrastructure Engineering,"Corrosion in reinforced concrete structures is among the major degradation mechanisms. The quantification and description of the spatial distribution of the corrosion condition within a structure on the basis of condition assessments are important. This study considered half-cell potential mapping data as a widely used technique to detect corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. A four-step workflow was proposed to analyse half-cell potential data with geostatistical techniques, first consisting of trend identification and possible trend removal. The obtained residuals were then subjected to a quantile-quantile transformation. Subsequently, experimental variograms were calculated and fitted with variogram models to estimate the correlation lengths. A case study with data from a road tunnel confirms the applicability of the workflow. It was assumed that the identified trend is primarily a result of the heterogeneity of the exposure conditions within the structure that ranges several metres. The residuals are interpreted as the result of the heterogeneities of material resistances that give rise to spatial variability in corrosion probability on a shorter distance range.

Detection of Concrete Cover of Reinforcements in Reinforced Concrete Wall by Microwave Thermography with Transmission Approach,Sam Ang Keo; Franck Brachelet; Didier Defer; Florin Breabăn,2022,10.3390/app12199865,Applied Sciences,"Concrete cover has an important role in reinforced concrete (RC) structures because it protects reinforcement bars from the bad effects of weather, fire, and bad environmental conditions that cause the corrosion of the reinforcements. Although it is an essential parameter to be considered for structural health monitoring (SHM), its detection by infrared thermography, especially in the heating phase, has not been accessed yet. The detailed analysis and discussions of physical phenomena, known as diffraction and interference, affecting the thermograms during the detection of the steel bars by microwave thermography have given an essential key for resolving this issue. The present paper proposes an innovative methodology with microwave thermography for determining the concrete cover thickness of one-layer reinforcements (12 mm in diameter and regularly placed at 10 cm) in an RC wall (1 m × 1 m × 6.5 cm). By using the transmission approach with five angles of microwave antenna direction (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60°) and the Snell–Descartes law and linear law, the proposed methodology leads us to deduce the approximate value of the concrete cover thickness (37.74 mm), which is close to the real value (38 mm), as well as the spacing of the steel bars and dielectric constant of the concrete.

Study Regarding the Evaluation of Prediction Models for Determining the Concrete Compressive Strength Using Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Data: Validation Stage,Bogdan Bolborea; Sorin Dan; Cornelia Baeră; Aurelian Gruin; Felicia Enache,2022,10.4028/p-5w046c,"Diffusion and defect data, solid state data. Part B, Solid state phenomena/Solid state phenomena","In the evaluation of an existing reinforced concrete structure, a fundamental issue is determining the concrete compressive strength as accurately as possible. This process can be conducted by using destructive and non-destructive methods. The destructive method presumes a limited number of cores extracted from the concrete structure. A higher number of cores would affect the structural safety and is time and resource consuming. Therefore, the conclusions drawn using exclusively this method can also generate errors in correctly estimating the load bearing capacity of a structure, thus leading to the possibility of implementing deficient measures in order to ensure a structural safety. Data obtained via non-destructive methods are more comprehensive. Due to their non-destructive nature, there are no limitations regarding the number of elements investigated and are fast in delivering results. One of the main concerns of researchers in this field is developing a direct relationship between the measured indicators through non-destructive testing (NDT) methods and concrete compressive strength. Over the years different equations with different mathematical structure (linear, polynomial, power, exponential and logarithmic) were developed with the main purpose of delivering fast and accurate results concerning concrete compressive strength by the means of NDT. The aim of this paper is to validate some of the most important prediction models using an original set of data. The database consists in a number of 96 concrete cores that were subjected to Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) and Schmidt Rebound Hammer (SRH) testing. The accuracy of the results was determined by using two statistical parameters the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The proposed equations have been analyzed in terms of prediction and dispersion of values. It was noticed that some of the formulations predict values that are higher than the ones obtained destructively, others provide a larger dissipation of values, while some equations deliver a compact distribution of results with higher rate in terms of accuracy.

To this end, this study investigates the efficiency of using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) as a non-destructive testing (NDT) method in assessing the core compressive strength loss, elastic modulus decrease, and tensile strength loss of concrete under extreme temperatures. RC specimens are fabricated and exposed to elevated temperatures (300°C, 400°C, 500°C, 600°C, and 700°C). GPR measurements are performed to estimate the relative dielectric permittivity (RDP) of the specimens before fire exposure (BFE) and after fire exposure (AFE). The compressive strengths of the cores extracted from the specimens are obtained also for BFE and AFE cases. Attained RDP values are in conformance with the previous research results and contribute additional evidence to the published literature. As the temperature levels are increased, RDP and strength-related values of concrete specimens decrease. The strength-related parameters are more sensitive to elevated temperatures, whereas the change in the RDP values is rather gradual. Through multiple correlations within 95% confidence intervals, core compressive strength loss, elastic modulus decrease, and tensile strength loss are, individually, estimated as a function of relative RDP change and applied temperature levels. Empirical formulas are obtained with high coefficients of correlation. The relative effects of RDP change and temperature are more pronounced in elastic modulus decrease and tensile strength loss compared to compressive strength loss. Overall, the outcomes of this paper confirm the viability of using the GPR technique for concrete dielectric characterisation in estimating the strength-related properties of concrete exposed to high temperatures, which might reduce the need for destructive testing.",4,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1080/10589759.2022.2140155,https://openalex.org/W4308968471,Tasks: strength

Ground Penetrating Radar scans showed satisfactory concrete cover for the top reinforcement in the deck, indicating negligible surface wearing and construction error.

The calculated neutral axis depths of the composite girders using an initial and follow-up load test after about a year were found to be in the web, indicating only 59% partially composite action.

Traditionally, RC structures are evaluated by taking core samples from a limited number of structural elements for concrete strength and performing spot checks for the steel reinforcement by removing the concrete cover. In-situ concrete strength is determined through compression testing of core samples. Through spot checks, conformance of the existing reinforcement with the structural drawings is evaluated and a reinforcement realization factor is calculated for use in the analyses. Even though these conventional methods are relatively more accurate and reliable for condition assessment of existing RC structures, they are destructive, involved, time taking, slow and expensive. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are proposed as a solution to this problem. Using NDT methods in conjunction with a relatively small number of core tests potentially allows for more rapid yet still reliable condition assessment of existing structures.

The problem with testing compact objects is that it is impossible to unambiguously determine the required resonant frequency $${{f}_{0}}\sim {\text{1/}}H$$ determined by the product thickness $$H$$ on the spectrum of the compact product against the background of closely spaced numerous resonances determined by other test object dimensions. Another reason is that due to a strong influence of the geometric dispersion of the sound speed in compact products, it is necessary to calculate a correction factor $$\beta $$ for each new compact test object. The article proposes a solution to the problem of testing compact concrete building structures using a multiplicative impact echo method that allows one to determine the desired resonant frequency, as well as using various versions of the correlation impact echo method that allow one to measure the speed of sound in compact products for the subsequent determination of concrete strength both in the process of cement solidification and during the operation of building structures in order to predict the trouble-free service life of buildings and structures.",3,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1134/s106183092201003x,https://openalex.org/W4226057652,Tasks: deterioration

Use of advanced thermographic signal processing techniques to improve the subsurface damage detection in concrete columns under varying solar exposure,Sandra Pozzer; Francisco Dalla Rosa; Zacarias Martin Chamberlain Pravia; Fernando López; Xavier Maldague,2022,10.1117/12.2619241,,"Infrared Thermography (IRT) is a Nondestructive Testing (NDT) method that can complement the concrete infrastructure condition assessment in a fast and contactless manner. When applied to large structures in outdoor areas, the heat source is usually the Sun, which is dynamic and varies through the days, months, and year. Solar irradiation is vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions, which affects the upcoming IRT measurements. Besides that, vertical elements have multiple locations and orientations, where the solar exposure varies according to the solar cycle. Consequently, column faces can experience reduced energy flow, where low or inexistent thermal contrast restrains the detection of existing subsurface damages. In this study, three signal processing techniques, named Principal Component Thermography (PCT), Pulsed Phase Thermography (PPT), and Partial Least Square Thermography (PLST), were applied to thermograms sequences acquired from a concrete element under varying solar exposure. One reinforced concrete column was constructed with ten simulated subsurface defects positioned in the Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest faces. This column was inspected hourly through different days of summer and winter periods. It was demonstrated the difference between the signature contrast registered in thermograms acquired from faces exposed to small and large periods of solar irradiation. The preliminary results of using thermographic signal processing techniques verified the possibility of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and thermal contrast in elements under unfavorable solar exposure.

Carbonation Depth and Permeability of Quaternary Hybrid Fiber Concretes,Muzeyyen Balcıkanlı Bankır; Umur Korkut Sevim,2022,10.1061/(asce)mt.1943-5533.0004350,Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering,"Concrete structures are exposed to water throughout their service life. Nowadays, fiber-reinforced concrete is the most preferred concrete due to its superior mechanical properties. However, good mechanical properties alone cannot protect concrete against the environmental conditions it may encounter during its service life. In particular, water is an inevitable factor faced by concrete elements. In this study, the permeability properties of concrete produced with different combinations of four different fibers were investigated. Hybrid fiber concrete (HFC) was made using the central composite design method. Steel, glass fiber, synthetic, and polypropylene fibers were hybridized among themselves, and the aggregate and paste phases of concrete were hybridized with electric arc furnace slag aggregate (EAFS) and fly ash (FA), respectively. Ultrasonic pulse rate, rapid chloride permeability (RCP), capillary water absorption capacity, and carbonation depth (CD) of HFC were determined. Statistically significant and nonsignificant parameters for each response were determined. Simultaneous substitution of EAFS and FA reduced the capillarity coefficient and CD of HFC. The RCP of HFC depends mainly on two factors: binder dosage and steel fiber ratio. The most suitable fiber for reducing CD was glass fiber. The estimated RCP, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), and capillary water absorption capacity (CWAC) results were compared with the control sample, and the results were 81%, 114%, and 86% of the control sample.",2,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)mt.1943-5533.0004350,https://openalex.org/W4283165184,Tasks: deterioration
Validation of wireless impact echo prototype for condition assessment of concrete structures,Martin Noël; Françis Lacroix; Farid Moradi; Hamed Layssi; FPrimeC Solutions Inc,2022,10.58286/27243,e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing,"A new wireless impact echo prototype was developed for the condition assessment of reinforced concrete slabs. The new system includes a wireless handheld sensing device which connects by Bluetooth to a tablet equipped with a user-friendly software for managing the testing grid, recording measurements, processing and transforming the data to a frequency domain, and presenting the results in real time. To validate the device, three large-scale concrete slabs of dimensions 2000 mm x 2000 mm x 300 mm were fabricated with artificial defects including voids, delamination, vertical cracks, and geometric discontinuities. The influence of slab boundaries, defect depth and location, overall thickness, steel reinforcement, and an internal conduit on the obtained measurements were investigated. The results were also compared with other commercial non-destructive testing devices including ground penetrating radar (GPR) and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPE), and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Overall, the results suggest that the impact echo technique using the new wireless prototype is able to accurately detect and characterise various defect types provided that the right size of impactor is used. Use of improper impactor sizes can result in alternative vibration modes depending on the slab thickness and defect depth; in that case, multiple readings may be required. The new system greatly improved the ease-of-use of the impact echo technique, although the inspector should be trained to properly interpret the results. Compared with the GPR technique, the impact echo system was not as rapid and unable to detect the location of steel reinforcement; on the other hand, it was better able to detect defects in the presence of steel bars which tended to obscure readings using GPR. UPE measurements were also faster than the impact echo tests and performed well for slab thickness measurements and detection of certain defect types; however, readings were found to be affected by the presence of steel reinforcement and in some cases were inconsistent. Overall, it may be concluded that each technique presents certain strengths and weaknesses that should be considered in the condition assessment strategy. The results obtained from each technique are complementary and may be used to develop a complete understanding of the internal state of the structure.",1,article,True,https://doi.org/10.58286/27243,https://openalex.org/W4316661968,Tasks: geometry

So, in this research, the compressive strength of wet and dry cured mixes made with RCA and steel fibre (SF) at 1.5% by volume was evaluated by mean of point load test (PLT) and ultrasonic method. As per the experimental outputs, the standard deviation (SD) values increased up to 20% by increasing the substitution amount of natural aggregate with RCA from 50% to 100%. In addition, the point load index (PLI) of wet cured concrete mixes was obtained averagely about 14.3% more than that of dry cured concrete mixes.

Ultrasonic measurements of grouted tendon ducts in the concrete structure using Elop Insight Scanner,Kamal Raj Chapagain; Werner Bjerke; Sanat Wagle; Werner Bjerke; ELOP Technology,2022,10.58286/27255,e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing,"Infrastructures such as bridges, tunnels, dams, retaining walls, docks, parking garages and buildings are constructed from reinforced concrete. These structures deteriorate due to cyclic temperature and loading variations, aging, as well as physical causes such as accidents and aggressive chemical attack from the environment. Post tension tendon ducts commonly used in bridges are filled with grout and steel tendons. The voids in the grout inside the tendon ducts can occur due various reasons such as improper filling, material mixing, blockage due to tendons etc. The water can penetrate in these voids inside the tendon ducts which can initiate corrosion. It is therefore vital to detect voids/ unfilled or defective portions of the tendon ducts at an early stage of the construction phase to ensure the strength and safety of the structure. Different types of NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) methods are frequently used for monitoring such infrastructures during regular operation to prevent failure, increase life span and improve safety. One of these NDT techniques, ultrasonic testing, is relatively simple in operation and gives more accurate description of air pockets, voids, cracks, and delaminations in the concrete structures compared to other NDT methods. ELOP has developed a rolling ultrasonic scanner COBRI (COncrete and BRidge Inspection) together with a complete software solution for asset management of structures for faster and better inspection and monitoring of the internal condition of the concrete. It will provide asset owners with information about when, where and how to inspect, maintain and more accurately assess damages and overall condition of their structures. The COBRI scanner contains an array of transducers assembled in two separate rollers used in pitch-catch mode. It uses a patented elastomer solution to provide dry coupling to the concrete surface during scanner movement, without the need for any added fluid couplant. The system uses SAFT (Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique) algorithm for image reconstruction to increase image quality and signal to noise ratio. It will provide users with improved tomographic (B, C and D-scan) image quality and 3D imaging. In the current work, we have used the COBRI scanner to explore its ability to image grouting defects inside tendon ducts used in concrete structures. The concrete specimen used in the evaluation has two tendon ducts positioned at 8 cm from the top surface with dimensions of 70 cm in length, 55 cm in width and 25 cm in thickness with average aggregate size of 22 mm. One of the tendon ducts is completely empty. The second one is half-length fully filled with grouting along the prestressed steel and other half only three quarters filled, leaving an air cavity on the top. The scanner is rolled approximately 50 cm over the concrete surface and the tomographic (B, C and D-scan) SAFT images are generated at different locations of the concrete specimen together with a 3D volume image. The results showed that the COBRI scanner is able to differentiate the filled and partially filled tendon ducts in the concrete structure. As COBRI is a rolling ultrasound scanner, it will help the bridge owners to scan and assess the grouting defects in the tendon ducts much more efficiently than other scanners available in the market.",1,article,True,https://doi.org/10.58286/27255,https://openalex.org/W4316661955,Tasks: deterioration

This paper presents a new approach for measuring the progression and extent of pitting-type (non-uniform) corrosion in reinforced concrete members by combining both non-destructive testing with optical fibre sensing results. Accelerated corrosion on the reinforcement (rebar) of the specimen was produced artificially using an alternate wetting and drying process in sodium chloride solution with 7.5% and 10% concentrations. The multimode optical fibre patch cords were attached to the reinforcement in three different arrangements in a single specimen (normal optical patch cord and loose and firm microbend patch cords). Intensity loss in a propagating light travelling inside an optical fibre takes place due to the development of pressure from surrounding concrete on the fibre from rust formation (corrosion). The study also describes the effect of corrosion in half-cell potentiometer, chloride ion resistivity and indirect pulse velocity readings obtained from the specimen. A later study found that the use of an optical microbend sensor is an effective alternate method for determining the starting time of initial depassivation in the reinforcement and validates it using half-cell potentiometer values. The study also developed models to predict overall mass loss in the rebar due to corrosion using combined non-destructive testing methods.",1,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1784/insi.2022.64.5.252,https://openalex.org/W4280502825,Tasks: moisture
NDT assessment of a thick-walled reinforced concrete mock-up of NPP concrete structures,Fahim Al-neshawy; Miguel Ferreira; Jari Puttonen,2022,10.58286/27190,e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing,"Different materials within the Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) concrete structure can undergo ageing process which causes defects in the materials and can lose, partially or totally, their designed function. The typical defects include corrosion of reinforcement steel, delamination, cracks, malfunction of post-tensioning or steel composite systems etc. The testing methods to detect the defects of concrete structures are (i) destructive examinations and (ii) non-destructive testing (NDT). The challenges for assessing the performance of the NPP concrete structures using (NDT) methods include (i) the limited access time (only during the annual overhauls) and (ii) the accuracy and reliability of the available NDT testing devices. To overcome these challenges, a mock-up wall representing a section of the concrete containment of the NPP was built. Simulated defects and errors were embedded inside the wall such as dimensional errors, honeycombing, delamination, and voids in the post-tensioned grouted tendon ducts. Different NDT techniques and combinations were used for assessing the simulated defects of the mock-up wall. These techniques included basic NDT methods as rebound hammer, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and concrete cover meter and advanced NDT as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and ultrasonic pulse echo (MIRA and MONOLITH). The results of basic NDT techniques as concrete cover meter, rebound hammer and UPV presented the basic characteristic properties of the concrete mock-up wall as concrete cover depth, compressive strength, and quality of concrete. The use of advanced NDT as GPR and MIRA and MONOLITH enabled us to detect and locate the embedded defect and the construction faults inside the mock-up wall.

Validating a physics-based automatic classification scheme for Impact Echo signals on data from a concrete slab with known defects,Agnimitra Sengupta; Hoda Azari; Ilgin Guler; Parisa Shokouhi,2022,10.58286/27233,e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing,"Impact Echo (IE) is capable of locating subsurface defects in concrete slabs from vibrational response of the slab to mechanical impact. For an intact slab (‘good’ condition), the frequency spectrum of IE is dominated by a peak corresponding to the slab’s ‘thickness resonance frequency’ since much of the impact energy is reflected from the bottom of the deck. The presence of subsurface defects (‘fair’ or ‘poor’ conditions) could manifest in various ways such as multiple distinct peaks at frequencies higher or lower than the thickness resonance. Energy distribution across different frequency bands varies with the type and extent of damage. In previous research, the authors have proposed a frequency partitioning of the spectrum for IE signal classification. First, the thickness resonance frequency band is identified using Gaussian Mixture modeling. Next, IE signals are represented by their energy distribution in three bands – frequencies less than, within and greater than thickness resonance. IE signals are reduced to feature vectors representing the proportion of energy in each band. Following the feature extraction, an unsupervised clustering approach is used to identify the centroids for each signal class – good, fair, poor, which is used to classify any test signal into one of the three classes. The classification is developed by training on unlabeled IE signals from real bridge deck data (Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) InfoBridge dataset) without making use of any labeled data. This study aims to validate the proposed methodology developed based on field data on a labeled dataset of eight reinforced concrete specimens constructed at FHWA Advanced Sensing Technology NDE laboratory with known artificial defects: shallow and deep delamination, honeycombing and voids. Findings indicate that the physics-based feature definition and the method developed on real bridge data is robust and can classify IE signals in the labeled data with high accuracy.",0,article,True,https://doi.org/10.58286/27233,https://openalex.org/W4316661832,Tasks: defects

The results indicated that modified rubberized concrete prepared by 5 to 20% WRTCs as a substitute to natural aggregate, provided lower CS and weight lose expose to sulphate and acid attacks compared to control specimen prepared by ordinary Portland cement (OPC).

Deep Learning-Based Rebar Clutters Removal and Defect Echoes Enhancement in GPR Images,Jing Wang; Kefu Chen; Hanchi Liu; Jiaqi Zhang; Wenqiang Kang,2021,10.1109/access.2021.3088630,IEEE Access,"The clutters of rebar in the ground penetrating radar (GPR) images may mask the echoes of the inner defects under the rebars, which adversely affects the identification of the inner structural defects in the reinforced concrete (RC). In this study, a deep learning-based method for rebar clutters removal and defect echoes enhancement in GPR B-scan images was proposed. The residual-inception blocks and attention modules were designed in the network as per the characteristics of the task. Validation of the method has been performed at three levels: first using synthetic data, next by synthetic data superimposed with actual concrete background noise, and finally using a sandbox model test in a realistic scenario. The results indicate that the proposed method had the ability to effectively remove rebar clutters and reconstruct complete defect echoes, with performance superior to those of the traditional deep-learning based methods.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Approach for Predicting Concrete Compressive Strength by SonReb,Mario Bonagura; Lucio Nobile,2021,10.32604/sdhm.2021.015644,Structural durability & health monitoring,"The compressive strength of concrete is one of most important mechanical parameters in the performance assessment of existing reinforced concrete structures. According to various international codes, core samples are drilled and tested to obtain the concrete compressive strengths. Non-destructive testing is an important alternative when destructive testing is not feasible without damaging the structure. The commonly used non-destructive testing (NDT) methods to estimate the in-situ values include the Rebound hammer test and the Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity test. The poor reliability of these tests due to different aspects could be partially contrasted by using both methods together, as proposed.in the SonReb method. There are three techniques that are commonly used to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the SonReb measurements: computational modeling, artificial intelligence, and parametric multi-variable regression models. In a previous study the accuracy of the correlation formulas deduced from the last technique has been investigated in comparison with the effective compressive strengths based on destructive test results on core drilled in adjacent locations. The aim of this study is to verify the accuracy of Artificial Neural Approach comparing the estimated compressive strengths based on NDT measured parameters with the same effective compressive strengths.

Development of a Concrete Floating and Delamination Detection System Using Infrared Thermography,Pang‐jo Chun; Shogo Hayashi,2021,10.1109/tmech.2021.3106867,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,"Spalling of concrete fragments due to the deterioration of concrete structures can cause property damage or serious and even fatal accidents; thus, there is a need to detect such deterioration. Generally, the hammering test is employed as the main inspection method to prevent such concrete spalling; however, it requires close contact with the structure being tested. Getting close to the structure for inspection is expensive and time consuming, and if the structure is high up, there is a risk of falling. Therefore, in this study, we developed a system for inspecting concrete structures without approaching them, using infrared thermography. In order to detect floating and delamination using infrared thermography, it is necessary to find temperature irregularities caused by such damage from an infrared image, but such an inspection method has not been realized so far. There are two main reasons for this. First, it is difficult to evaluate whether the concrete structure is in an appropriate temperature condition suitable for detecting the floating and delamination. Second, it is difficult to detect temperature irregularities caused by floating and delamination among the various causes of temperature irregularities. In this study, we resolved these issues by developing equipment to investigate whether the object is in an appropriate temperature condition for proper photography and by developing a machine learning-based method to automatically detect only the temperature irregularities caused by floating and delamination. By resolving these issues, we have developed a promising novel inspection method for the prevention of concrete spalling, which is reported in this article.",36,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2021.3106867,https://openalex.org/W3201059747,Tasks: defects
Infrared thermography detection of delamination in bottom of concrete bridge decks,Babar Nasim Khan Raja; Saeed Miramini; Colin Duffield; Massoud Sofi; Lihai Zhang,2021,10.1002/stc.2886,Structural Control and Health Monitoring,"Infrared thermography (IRT) has been widely used in detecting the subsurface delamination of bridge deck. However, IRT inspection on delamination zones of the bridge deck which have limited exposure to direct solar radiation (e.g., the bottom surface of the bridge deck) is rather challenging due to the relatively low thermal contrast (∆T) development in these zones. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to conduct a series of experimental studies in conjunction with numerical modeling for investigating the effectiveness of IRT in delamination detection of bridge deck components which are normally not exposed to direct solar radiation. Specially, the effects of different environmental conditions, thickness of bridge deck, and defect characteristics on the absolute thermal contrast (∆T) development were systematically investigated. The results show that IRT can effectively detect the subsurface delamination of concrete bridge deck located in regions that are not exposed to the direct solar radiation. In addition, the development of detectable thermal contrast (&gt;0.5°C) is much dependent on the rate of change in ambient temperature with a suitable detection period between 8 am and 4 pm. Furthermore, it shows that the value of ∆T increases with the increase of bridge deck thickness and delamination size.",34,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1002/stc.2886,https://openalex.org/W3213320596,Tasks: defects

Interpreting Impact Echo Data to Predict Condition Rating of Concrete Bridge Decks: A Machine-Learning Approach,Agnimitra Sengupta; S. Ilgin Guler; Parisa Shokouhi,2021,10.1061/(asce)be.1943-5592.0001744,Journal of Bridge Engineering,"Maintaining the structural reliability of highway bridges under a budget constraint necessitates the development of accurate prediction models of bridge deck deterioration to maximize bridge service life while minimizing life-cycle costs. Traditionally, the structural condition of a bridge deck is assessed using ordinal discrete indices, referred to as condition ratings (CRs), assigned based on an assessment of the visible signs of deterioration. Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is being increasingly utilized to gain objective insights into structural deterioration. The impact echo (IE) test is a common NDE technique that relies on the acoustic resonance response of a bridge deck to detect subsurface delamination that can lead to spalling. However, IE data interpretation is largely done manually and the connection between the IE results and CRs is not fully explored. The aim of this study is to model the spectral characteristics of IE signals to quantify the structural integrity of bridge decks and predict CRs. First, a nearest neighbor clustering of IE signal energy distribution in the frequency domain is conducted to generate condition labels for each IE response (good, fair, poor) automatically. The condition labels are then input to a support vector machine (SVM) classification model to predict the CRs. The models are trained and tested using data from the Long-Term Bridge Performance (LTBP) data set pertaining to 38 tested bridges with recorded NDE data collected over a span of 2 years on average. The findings indicate that the proposed model is capable of automatically predicting CRs for bridge decks given the raw IE test data with an accuracy of 87.5%.",28,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)be.1943-5592.0001744,https://openalex.org/W3165707607,Tasks: deterioration

Specifically, the development of corrosion affects the necessary bond strength of rebar in concrete contributing to the loss of resilience and possible structural failures. It is thus essential to understand the effects of corrosion on bond strength so that remedial measures can be done on existing and deteriorating RC structures. Hence, this study investigated through laboratory experiments and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling the effects of corrosion on bond strength. Experimental results showed that at small amounts of corrosion less than 0.27%, the bond strength was observed to increase. At these levels, the amounts of corrosion products were sufficient enough to expand freely through the permeable structure of concrete and occupy the pore spaces. Beyond this level, however, the bond strength of concrete deteriorated significantly. There was an observed average decrease of 1.391 MPa in the bond strength values for every percent increase in the amount of corrosion. The expansive and progressive internal radial stress due to corrosion resulted to the development of internal and surface cracks in concrete. In the parametric investigation of the derived ANN model, the bond strength was also observed to decline continuously with the growth of corrosion derivatives as represented by the relative magnitudes of the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). The prediction results of the model can be utilized as basis for design and select appropriate mitigating measures to prolong the service life of concrete structures.",20,article,False,https://doi.org/10.12989/cac.2021.28.1.077,https://openalex.org/W3190548620,Tasks: deterioration

In this regard, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been a crucial alternative due to its non-invasiveness and convenience. This paper reports the experimental activities on a test-site area inside a camp in Shanghai, China. To assess the concrete structures of the building, GPR was employed for the detection and localization of rebars in columns, beams, and floors. From the GPR B-scan profiles acquired using a high-frequency antenna, the exact quantity of reinforcements was identified according to the hyperbola responses. Considering the difficulty of inferring the exact position and the scale of the rebars, we applied reverse time migration (RTM) to collapse the hyperbolic response and retrieve the target in a migrated image. To verify the effectiveness of the RTM algorithm, we carried out an experiment on a concrete model with three reinforced bars. We also utilized the RTM algorithm to process the B-scan profiles collected in a column that was later excavated. The imaging results validated the capacity of RTM in localizing and shaping rebars. Then, we employed the RTM algorithm for the GPR B-scan data collected from the other column. Based on the imaging profile, the quantity and positions of the rebars were correctly determined. Moreover, the thickness of the protective layer was evaluated according to the migrated result. These results demonstrate that GPR combined with RTM could provide useful foundation data for structural evaluation.",19,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13102020,https://openalex.org/W3165125709,Tasks: deterioration
Identifying Spatial and Temporal Variations in Concrete Bridges with Ground Penetrating Radar Attributes,Vivek Kumar; Isabel Morris; Santiago A. Lopez; Branko Glišić,2021,10.3390/rs13091846,Remote Sensing,"Estimating variations in material properties over space and time is essential for the purposes of structural health monitoring (SHM), mandated inspection, and insurance of civil infrastructure. Properties such as compressive strength evolve over time and are reflective of the overall condition of the aging infrastructure. Concrete structures pose an additional challenge due to the inherent spatial variability of material properties over large length scales. In recent years, nondestructive approaches such as rebound hammer and ultrasonic velocity have been used to determine the in situ material properties of concrete with a focus on the compressive strength. However, these methods require personnel expertise, careful data collection, and high investment. This paper presents a novel approach using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to estimate the variability of in situ material properties over time and space for assessment of concrete bridges. The results show that attributes (or features) of the GPR data such as raw average amplitudes can be used to identify differences in compressive strength across the deck of a concrete bridge. Attributes such as instantaneous amplitudes and intensity of reflected waves are useful in predicting the material properties such as compressive strength, porosity, and density. For compressive strength, one alternative approach of the Maturity Index (MI) was used to estimate the present values and compare with GPR estimated values. The results show that GPR attributes could be successfully used for identifying spatial and temporal variation of concrete properties. Finally, discussions are presented regarding their suitability and limitations for field applications.",19,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091846,https://openalex.org/W3162795814,Tasks: strength

This parameter will assess the consistency of the fresh concrete during transportation process. The characteristics of the end product was evaluated through various tests conducted on hardened concrete samples, namely, compressive strength, flexural strength, depth of penetration of water under pressure, rapid chloride penetration test, carbonation test and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test. All results recorded were compared with the reference concrete values. Findings The results demonstrated that the use of C&amp;DWM in concrete portrayed prospective characteristics that could eventually change the concept of sustainable concrete. It was noted that the compressive and flexural strength decreased with the addition of C&amp;DWM, but nevertheless, a continuous increase in strength was observed with an increase in curing period. Moreover, the increase in rapid chloride penetration and decrease in UPV over time period suggested that the concrete structure has improved in terms of compactness, thus giving rise to a less permeable concrete. The mechanical tests showed little discrepancies in the final results when compared to reference concrete. Therefore, it is opined that C&amp;DWM can be used effectively in concrete. Originality/value This study explores the possible utilisation of C&amp;DWM as a suitable surrogative materials in concrete in a practical perspective, where the slump parameter will be kept constant throughout the experimental process.

One of the modern methods used in the test of concrete strength is the non-destructive testing applying the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). In this study, the ultrasonic pulse velocity technique as non-destructive testing of concrete was used to distinguish concrete mixture design and show the predictive relationship between compressive strength and UPV. The effect of various grades of concrete (M15, M20, M25, M30, and M35) with water to cement ratio (w/c) of 0.45 and 0.5 were examined. It was observed that grade M15 cubes had the lowest transit time (37.6 – 41.2 µs) and grade M35 cubes had the highest transit time (48.7 – 49.9 µs) showing that the concrete with short transit time generates the highest pulse velocity than that with low transit time. Grade M15 cubes had the highest pulse velocity (3.6 – 4.0 km/s) and grade M35 cubes had the lowest pulse velocity (3.0 – 3.1 km/s). M15 cubes had the lowest actual compressive strength (18.1 – 19.3 N/mm2) and grade M35 cubes have the highest actual compressive strength (34.6 – 36.0 N/mm2).

It aimed primarily to determine the utility of thermographic techniques in the detection of flaws such as cracks, moisture content and detachment. On the other hand, the limitations of IR techniques and the errors most commonly committed in interpreting the results must be identified to determine how to avoid misleading interpretations. The survey methodology deployed here followed a procedure established for earlier studies of historic buildings in which preliminary fact sheets were drawn up to determine the areas of the building’s structural members most in need of assessment.

Visual damage identification of concrete cylinders with steel‐fiber‐reinforced composite bars based on acoustic emission,Yuzhu Guo; Xudong Chen; Yu Tang; Jin Wu,2021,10.1002/stc.2880,Structural Control and Health Monitoring,"Steel-fiber-reinforced composite bar (SFCB) is a composite bar composed of a crescent-rib steel bar and an outer protruded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) layer. Due to its unique post-yield stiffness and superior anti-corrosion behavior, the SFCB is except to be an ideal reinforcement for concrete structures subject to a high corrosion environment. For SFCB-reinforced concrete cylinders, their internal damage mechanism has never been experimentally studied but was usually speculated with the brittle failure due to the potential brittle fracture of the SFCB. To reveal the compression damage mechanism of SFCB-reinforced concrete cylinders, a uniaxial compression test for SFCB-reinforced concrete cylinders was carried out at first. The entire damage process of SFCB-reinforced concrete cylinders was monitored in real-time by acoustic emission (AE), a widely used nondestructive testing method. The test result shows that the SFCB-reinforced concrete cylinders fail after the buckling of longitudinal SFCB or the fracture of the stirrup. The intensity signal analysis of AE proves the failure mode of the SFCB-reinforced concrete cylinder was close to a plastic failure instead of a brittle failure. Furthermore, a new damage visualization method is proposed to analyze the internal damage of the concrete cylinders by using the spatial b value of AE. The T value was constructed by combining the spatial b value with the density distribution of AE events. It is proven that the T value is highly sensitive to the serious damages of the concrete cylinders and can be used to identify the damage locations inside the concrete cylinders.",12,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1002/stc.2880,https://openalex.org/W3212651266,Tasks: defects
The assessment of concrete subjected to preloading using non destructive testing methods,Azad A. Mohammed; Serwan Rafiq; Niyan A. Hamid,2021,10.1016/j.cscm.2021.e00705,Case Studies in Construction Materials,"Different non-destructive tests are in use for the structural health monitoring. Test variables affecting non destructive behavior of concrete were discussed by some researchers, including the effect of instantaneous loading during testing for ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). This study aimed at determining rebound number (RN) using Schmidt hammer and UPV of concrete subjected to short term and continuous loadings. Tests were carried out on concrete cubes and cylinders to study the effect of short term loading, while to apply a continuous loading, reinforced concrete beams were loaded inside a rigid steel frame. Reduction of RN and UPV for concrete subjected to 80% compressive loading was found to be 8.1% and 10% respectively. There is some effect of loading cycle at high loading level especially for lower strength concrete. Also, RN was found to reduce with increasing tensile short term loading, in which for lower strength concrete reached 5%. There is a continuous reduction in UPV percentage with increasing tensile loading level, especially for lower strength concrete but the effect of tensile loading was found to be smaller than that of compressive loading. Analysis of data was made and equations were presented to calculate the changes take place due to short term loading effects. It is concluded that for concrete under continuous tensile stress, equations for UPV-compressive strength relationship should be modified with a reduction factor of 0.87 or calculated from an equation proposed in this study.",10,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2021.e00705,https://openalex.org/W3201346712,Tasks: strength

Hence, a lot of steel and power plants have been established in this region. From these power plants, a huge amount of fly ash and pond ash is generated daily, and these ashes are occupying large landfill areas. The carbon dioxide released from the chimneys of these plants not only pollutes the local air mass but also creates the problem of carbonation of local concrete structures. The corrosion of RCC structures in this highly industrialized local region surrounded by industry is accelerated due to the high emission of carbon dioxide. Hence, the strength and durability of concrete must be checked for the partial replacement of cement and sand with locally available industrial wastes in order to ascertain its long-term performance. The present investigation was taken up to do a detailed study on workability, durability, and strength of concrete by replacing cement with fly ash by weight up to 40% and sand with pond ash by volume up to 20% with a constant dose of glass fiber of 0.1% of the volume of the concrete. Various tests like rheology, shrinkage, electrical resistivity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, heat conductivity, leaching, compressive strength and flexural strength were conducted on various mixes of new coal ash fiber reinforced concrete.

Five mixtures were considered: three with differently treated Spanish broom fibers, a polypropylene fiber mixture, and a reference concrete mixture. The concrete and reinforced concrete samples were first dried to 100 °C, then heated to 400 °C, and left to cool to room temperature. The samples were tested immediately and 96 h after cooling. The compressive strength, weight loss, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and dynamic modulus of elasticity were determined and compared. The cross-sectional images of the concrete samples captured through an optical microscope were observed and analyzed. The changes in fiber structure were monitored by TG/DTG analysis. The results of the study indicate that even the reference concrete mixture did not have satisfactory residual properties.

If corrosion detection tools based on techniques such as half-cell potential (HCP), linear polarization resistance (LPR), or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are used for the assessment of systems with FBE-coated steel rebars without considering the difference in the electrochemical conditions between coated and uncoated systems, then the interpretation can result in the inability to detect ongoing corrosion. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine the suitability of these inspection methods and data to be applied to the RC systems with FBE-coated steel rebars. For this, the suitability of test methods on HCP, LPR, and EIS for assessing corrosion conditions of RC structures was assessed using laboratory specimens and field structures. Field investigation using HCP shows that the HCP could not detect corrosion of FBE-coated steel rebars unless the coating was severely disbonded due to corrosion of steel rebars. Also, the suitability of test methods on HCP, LPR, and EIS was assessed by additional laboratory specimens.

Defining concrete compressive strength by combining the results of different NDT methods,Fahim Al-Neshawy; Hassan Ahmed,2021,,Aaltodoc (Aalto University),"Compressive strength is an essential characteristic of reinforced concrete structures. Standards and codes of practice give rules for the assessment of the structural compressive strength of hardened concrete in situ, which are to be compared with the strength class used in design. In this report, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods were used to map the compressive strength variations of the concrete mock-up wall. A combination of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) and Rebound (Schmidt) Hammer were used to estimate the in-situ compressive strength of concrete. \nCompressive strength estimation models were generated using NDT methods with a minimal number of drilled concrete cores in order to calibrate the NDT methods. Reliability of the estimated compressive strength values was a challenge when assessing the in-situ strength of the mock-up wall. The factors affecting the compressive strength estimation models include the number of test location for cores used to identify the model, quality of measurements, the type of NDT technique, the use of single or combined NDT techniques, and the model identification approach. \nThis report presents the on-site evaluation of concrete strength using combined NDT techniques. The investigation was carried out on a thick-walled reinforced concrete mock-up wall. The test results show some variation in the compressive strength when applying the combined NDT techniques. The prediction of compressive strength carried out shows how the use of known destructive methodologies associated with a combined non-destructive method improves the accuracy of the estimation of the concrete compressive strength if the NDT methods are calibrated using enough test samples.",2,article,False,https://openalex.org/W3214729203,https://openalex.org/W3214729203,Tasks: strength
Simulation of corrosion field measurement on reinforced concrete using BEM,Muhammad Ihsan; Syarizal Fonna; Nurul Islami; Faizar; Ahmad Kamal Ariffin,2021,10.15282/jmes.15.2.2021.11.0636,JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCES,"Reinforced concrete (RC) corrosion is a leading of structural deterioration and premature degradation for the infrasturctures, with significant affected for safety, durability and reability. Therefore, early assessment of RC corrosion is important to prevent deterioration of the structure. The objective of this paper is to apply Boundary Element Method (BEM) for improving reinforced concrete (RC) corrosion assessment using field measurement data. In this study, the potential on whole domain of concrete structures was modeled by Laplace equation. The Laplace equation was solved by BEM, hence the potential on the concrete structure can be determined. The field data were measured by using half-cell potential technique and collected from an existing house in Aceh region that struck by the 2004 Sumatra tsunami. The simulation results show the use of BEM can improve the RC corrosion assessment. According to ASTM C876, the distribution of potential values on the concrete surface above the corroded area were in range -200 mV to -350 mV that indicated active corrosion was occurred. It can be inferred, the method can improve the field measurement data since it has capability to predict the corrosion profiles of reinforcing steel in more precise.",2,article,True,https://doi.org/10.15282/jmes.15.2.2021.11.0636,https://openalex.org/W3168274877,Tasks: deterioration
Remote moisture quantification of concrete using SAR images and the K-R-I transform,Ahmed Alzeyadi; Tzuyang Yu,2021,10.1117/12.2582429,,"Moisture content in Portland cement concrete structures is commonly associated with many durability problems (e.g., steel corrosion) and can be used in structural health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation/testing (NDE/T) of concrete structures. While several intrusive techniques are available for quantifying moisture content inside concrete structures, it is a challenging task to estimate the moisture content of concrete in the field without using embedded moisture sensors. In this paper, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging as a nonintrusive technique and the K-R-I (curvature-area-amplitude) transform are applied to concrete panel specimens made of two water-to-cement (w/c) ratios (w/c = 0.4 and 0.5) for moisture determination. Concrete panel specimens with dimensions of 0.3 m-by-0.3 m-by-0.05 m were manufactured and conditioned in a laboratory environment by air-drying for three months. Its time-dependent moisture variation was simultaneously monitored by a 10.5- GHz center frequency SAR imaging sensor inside an anechoic chamber. Quantitative analysis of SAR images was carried out by using the K-R-I transform to understand the simultaneous change of SAR amplitude and distribution (contour shape) at different moisture contents. It was found that SAR amplitude and its distribution increase with the increase of moisture content inside concrete panel specimens. Spatial distribution of SAR amplitudes can be used to indicate subsurface moisture distribution inside concrete. The area-amplitude (R-I) curve of SAR images can be used to quantify the relationship between moisture content and its distribution.",2,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2582429,https://openalex.org/W3136924520,Tasks: moisture
Estimation of present-day strength of concrete for a 40-yearold building from non-destructive tests: A case study,Soubhagya Karmakar; Saha Dauji; Sandeep Shankar Kshirsagar; Satish Kumar Sahni; K. Showri bhargav,2021,10.18702/acf.2021.12.7.2.17,Journal of Asian Concrete Federation,"Assessment of the present health of existing concrete structures is necessary, particularly for enhancing the life of the infrastructure facilities reaching the end of their design life. The codes stipulate establishment of site-specific correlation expressions to estimate the compressive strength of concrete from indirect non-destructive tests (NDT) such as rebound hammer or ultrasonic pulse velocity tests. However, in certain circumstances, requisite number of partially destructive (core) tests required for establishing the site-specific equations might not be feasible. In such scenario, selection of a suitable correlation expression from literature has to be performed in a rational way, as discussed in this article with a case study of a 40-year-old concrete building. From the study, it has been observed that for the limited number of direct tests, the Indian code stipulation resulted in higher characteristic strength of concrete as compared to the parametric estimation, which can be attributed to the assumption of Normal distribution and code stipulated (conservative) standard deviation value. In case of the indirect estimation cases, the parametric characteristic strength was pretty close to the corresponding non-parametric values indicating that the fitted distributions represented the strength values very well. Recommendations for the suitable correlation expression from literature applicable for estimation of equivalent strength from NDT for the structure, recommendation for characteristic compressive strength of concrete and the suggestions for accounting for the inaccuracies in estimated strength in subsequent structural re-analysis have been provided from the results of the study.",2,article,True,https://doi.org/10.18702/acf.2021.12.7.2.17,https://openalex.org/W3212773109,Tasks: strength

Machine Learning Based NDT Data Fusion to Detect Corrosion in Reinforced Concrete Structures with Inspection Data,Patrick Pfändler; Ueli Angst,2021,10.5006/c2021-16392,,"Abstract The key idea is to deliver an automated, machine-learning (ML) based algorithm to combine the results from different non-destructive testing (NDT) measurements on a reinforced concrete wall in order to generally improve the reliability of the corrosion assessment. To this aim, a set of data was acquired with various NDT methods. The data include concrete cover measurements, half-cell potential mapping data, electrical resistance measurements (Wenner probe) in different grid sizes, and images from the concrete surface. After registration and preprocessing (interpolations and feature scaling), a ML algorithm was applied to cluster the data into groups. The aim was to examine the outcome of ML in comparison to traditional data analysis with manual cross-links between the individual measurements to locate corrosion damages such as cracks or cross-sectional due to chloride-induced corrosion. The surface images were analyzed by a convolutional neural network trained beforehand for the classification task (concrete crack/no concrete crack on the surface) to gain an additional numerical feature.

On the compressive and bond strength of reinforced concrete as structural properties,Francesco Moccia,2021,10.5075/epfl-thesis-7764,Infoscience (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne),"Traditionally, the concrete strength is measured on cubes or cylinders having normalized dimensions, suitable vibration and curing conditions and their strength is assessed in laboratory under fast loading rates. However, the in-situ strength of structural elements can considerably differ from that of a small and homogenous control specimen due to a number of issues. Notably, phenomena taking place during the consolidation process of fresh concrete may affect the compressive resistance of tall members as well as the bond strength of reinforcing bars located in top layers. During concrete consolidation, water migrates in the direction of the free surface while concrete settles downwards, phenomena referred as concrete bleeding and plastic settlement respectively. Under these circumstances, a decrease in the concrete properties near the upper surface is observed as well as a development of cracks and voids surrounding horizontal reinforcing bars, causing potential disturbances on the compressive stresses and affecting the mechanical engagement between bars and concrete. In addition, the response of structural concrete may differ from that of material samples due to non-uniform stress states, the material brittleness, the cracking induced by imposed strains, the rheological response of concrete and the presence of embedded disturbances. As a result, the strength measured in material samples needs to be corrected with strength reduction factors to ensure suitable structural analysis. In this thesis, an in-depth investigation is performed on the different phenomena affecting the compressive and bond strength of structural members. These aspects are assessed by means of several testing programmes instrumented with refined measurements techniques such as tomography and Digital Image Correlation. An extensive experimental programme comprising 76 column and prism tests was carried out to evaluate the influence of casting position, loading direction and bar disturbances on the compressive resistance of structural elements. The detailed measurements performed at the fresh and hardened state resulted in the proposal of consistent design rules accounting for the investigated phenomena. Focus was also given on the influence of material brittleness and the implications of internal stress redistributions on the structural response of reinforced concrete columns and compression zones of members in bending. The pertinence of the investigations were validated based on more than 400 column tests collected from the literature. The implications of casting conditions on pull-out and spalling failures were also assessed by means of 137 pull-out tests on reinforcing bars presenting variable diameter, concrete cover, casting height and embedded length. The investigations resulted in the proposal for a physically-consistent approach, evaluating the pull-out resistance as function of casting conditions and reinforcement characteristics. Finally, the phenomenon of cover spalling was examined with respect to the action of a radial inner pressure, as originated by bond engagement or associated to the volumetric expansion of corroded reinforcement. The mechanisms inducing spalling were analysed by means of a comprehensive experimental programme comprising 56 specimens instrumented with Digital Image Correlation. A mechanical model is eventually proposed to evaluate bond-related cases of cover spalling.",0,article,True,https://doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-7764,https://openalex.org/W3143892556,"Tasks: geometry, strength"
Determination of a Suitable Moment for Formwork Removal from a Concrete Structure Using Rebound Hammer Test Methods,Petr Misák; Dalibor Kocáb; Petr Cikrle,2021,10.4028/www.scientific.net/ssp.322.23,"Diffusion and defect data, solid state data. Part B, Solid state phenomena/Solid state phenomena","Determining the compressive strength of concrete in the early stages of ageing has been an increasingly relevant topic in recent years, particularly with regard to the safe removal of formwork from a structure or its part. The compressive strength of concrete which designates safe removal of formwork without damaging the structure can be referred to as ""stripping strength"". It is undoubtedly beneficial to be able to determine the moment of safe formwork removal in a non-destructive manner, i.e. without compromising the structure. Modern rebound hammer test methods seem to be a suitable instrument with which it is possible to reduce the length of technological breaks associated with concrete ageing to a minimum, and consequently, reduce the total cost of the construction. However, the use of these methods presents a number of challenges. As many conducted experiments have shown, there is no single conversion relationship (regression model) between non-destructive rebound hammer test methods and compressive strength. It is therefore advisable to always create a unique conversion relationship for each individual concrete. In addition, it must be noted that conventional regression analysis methods operate with 50% reliability. In construction testing, however, the most common is the so-called characteristic value, which is defined as a 5% quantile. This value is therefore determined with 95% reliability. This paper describes the construction of a so-called ""characteristic curve"", which can be used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in a structure using rebound hammer test methods with 95% reliability. Consequently, the values obtained from the characteristic curve can be easily used for practical applications.",0,article,False,https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/ssp.322.23,https://openalex.org/W3190949923,Tasks: strength

Tests of 21 HPSCC mixes were conducted to check the correlation between the relative residual UPV and other properties of concrete after exposure to elevated temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 800 °C. Considering the relative residual values instead of the absolute ones makes the quantitative evaluation by using UPV more feasible for the evaluation of the residual strength of concrete structures after exposure to elevated temperatures, where in this case the effect of the mix composition of concrete is small.

Different parameters are taken into account: embedment depths, masonry type, anchor position (injection either in brick units or in mortar joints). The axial load capacity and the failure mode are observed for each test. The results are examined by means of elastic and plastic models assessing the efficiency of anchors installed in headers, stretchers or mortar joints. The anchors injected in mortar joints are shown to have much greater pull-out capacity than that found for anchors in bricks. Passing from 90 to 160 mm of embedment depth, a minimum increase by 40% of pull-out strength is observed. The most common failure modes are the sliding failure, which occurs for short anchors or weak masonry, and mixed sliding/cone failure, for long anchors or strong masonry.

Subsequently, pull-out tests were carried out to examine the bonding resistance between steel and concrete. The study indicates the great influence of density of stirrups on the percentage mass loss of the embedded reinforcing bar, accompanied by width of surface concrete cracking, as well as on bond strength between steel and concrete. The results of bond stress–slip curves show that the densification of stirrups plays a significant role in bonding, leading to higher bond strength values and delaying the degradation of bond loss as corrosion damage increases. However, it becomes apparent that, although the densification of stirrups (Φ8/60 mm) result in the full anchorage of steel-reinforcing bars, it may be inappropriate, since it can lead to a substantial increase in costs and a rapid rise in corrosion rate, due to potential increase. Furthermore, the recorded values of relative slip at bond strength are between 1 and 3 mm, regardless of corrosion damage or concrete cracking, which depends on the ribs geometry and crushing of concrete in front of them. To conclude, the results of the present manuscript indicate that the increase in transverse reinforcement (stirrups) percentage plays a key role in the durability of reinforced concrete elements and in bond strength maintenance between rebar and concrete.",35,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/met10101327,https://openalex.org/W3092429856,Tasks: deterioration
Rebound Hammer Test: An Investigation into Its Reliability in Applications on Concrete Structures,Antonio Brencich; Rossella Bovolenta; Valeria Ghiggi; Davide Pera; Paolo Redaelli,2020,10.1155/2020/6450183,Advances in Materials Science and Engineering,"The issue of concrete strength often arises in civil engineering practice, either due to quality control of new constructions or due to the assessment of existing structures. To this aim, one of the most widely spread techniques is the rebound hammer (Schmidt hammer) test, for which calibration is still related to the original Schmidt curve dating back to the early 50’s. In spite of the large amount of research work performed in the last decades, the uncertainties of the rebound test are still not clearly quantified and open to further insight. This paper presents and discusses a wide research campaign on laboratory specimens and on third‐party specimens delivered to the Laboratory for Building Materials of the University of Genoa, Italy, for standard quality controls. While it is well known that moisture content, surface finishing, and concrete maturity strongly affect the test result, the effect of the stress state has not yet been studied and is found in this research to be a further parameter affecting the test reliability. The final outcome of all the uncertainties is variability in estimated concrete strength as large as ±70%; additionally, some issues are discussed on the intrinsic uncertainty of this test. As already demonstrated by many authors, the results of this research also show that a universal calibration curve to be used for any concrete, in any condition, conceptually does not exist.",29,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6450183,https://openalex.org/W3112447462,Tasks: moisture
Effect of Organic and Inorganic Corrosion Inhibitors on Strength Properties of Concrete,V Srinivasa Reddy; T. Prashanth; S P Raju; P. Francis Prashanth,2020,10.1051/e3sconf/202018401112,E3S Web of Conferences,"In the current study, the M25 grade concrete mixes are admixed with various locally available organic and non-organic corrosion inhibitors such as Calcium Nitrite, Sodium Nitrite, Hexamine and Di-ethanolamine to understand the influence of these organic and non-organic corrosion inhibitors on the strength and corrosion resistance properties of concrete. The percentage dosage of admixed inhibitors vary from 1 to 5% by the weight of cement. For M25 grade concrete the optimum percentages of corrosion inhibitor admixture was found to be 4% for Calcium Nitrite, 3% for Sodium Nitrite, 2% for Hexamine and 3% for Di-ethanolamine. Calcium Nitrite corrosion inhibitor admixture imparts increased compressive, split- tensile and flexural strength than other corrosion inhibitors at 28 days. All the corrosion inhibitors used in the study have enhanced the compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength of concrete. The initial gain of early strength decreased due to anodic process of inhibitors. Measured electrical resistivity and half-cell potential values of all corrosion inhibitors admixed M25 grade concrete mixes directs that calcium nitrate and Di-ethanolamine have shown high electrical resistance indicating their superior corrosion inhibition ability than sodium nitrite and hexamine. Accelerated corrosion test on reinforced concrete beams admixed with corrosion inhibitors confirmed that possible inception of corrosion in calcium nitrate admixed reinforced concrete beams is very low when compared to other corrosion inhibitors used for the study.",29,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202018401112,https://openalex.org/W3063975082,Tasks: strength

Currently, assessing the performance and safety of reinforced concrete (RC) structures relies on routine-based visual inspection (VI). However, there are another non-destructive test (NDT) technique that can provide a more accurate assessment of the structures. Thus, in this study, a footbridge located in Liverpool, UK is chosen as a case study and has NDT techniques used for assessment. The main objective of this research is to determine the condition of structural bridge components and investigate its level of defect and deterioration using non-destructive tests. The methodologies involved are visual inspection, and NDT techniques include the rebound hammer, cover meter, Moisture Content &amp; Depth of Carbonation Testing, Chloride Testing and Half Cell Test. The framework, when implemented with the best selection of NDT techniques, helps in determining the level of defect and deterioration of the structural bridge components and next recommendation regarding the condition of the bridge. The involved bridge structural components include column, deck, wall and staircase. Findings from the visual inspection show that there were many defects and deteriorations found at the structural bridge components, which includes crack, spalling, and delamination and rusting. Further, NDT techniques that were carried out at the selected bridge structural part shows that some of the components exhibited a moderate risk of corrosion and acceptable concrete surface quality.

In this study, different proportions of Duras S500 fibre were employed to investigate the self-sealing capacity of environmentally friendly, highly damped, fibre-reinforced concrete (EFHDFRC) containing 5% crumb rubber. The workability of EFHDFRC with different proportions of the fibre was investigated by mechanical properties test. The self-sealing capacity was first measured by introducing the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test combined with the damage degree in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the regained compressive strength test and visual inspection were applied as additional measures of the self-sealing capacity. The experimental results show that EFHDFRC with different proportions of fibre showed the maximum sealing degree between the 42nd and 51st days after casting the concrete. EFHDFRC with 0.1% fibre had the best performance and the maximum self-sealing degree (2.82%). In summary, it has been proven that 0.1% fibre could stimulate the self-sealing capacity of EFHDFRC by bridging cracked concrete. Moreover, it is noted that sufficient space in cracks is essential for precipitation formation, which could seal the cracks.

The post-installed screw pull-out test: Development of a method for assessing in-situ concrete compressive strength,Salam Al‐Sabah; Shah Nur Alam Sourav; Ciarán McNally,2020,10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101658,Journal of Building Engineering,"In concrete structures, the current methodology for concrete strength estimation combines the use of in-situ test methods with destructive techniques (taking cores). In-situ tests are indirect approaches, and can be affected by several uncontrolled factors, thus inducing uncertainty in the strength estimate. Low cost in-situ methods are often deployed in practice, without taking due consideration of the low reliability. Thus, the reliability of the estimated concrete strength is always a questionable issue. In this context, this paper seeks to develop an in-situ test method as an alternative to the available techniques to assess in-situ compressive strength of concrete. The PSP test is proposed based on the modified pullout testing of post-installed screw. The test is a partially destructive technique that involves insertion of an oversized screw into a predrilled hole in the hardened concrete and subsequent pullout of the screw compelling the concrete to follow a specific failure pattern – a complete pullout failure. The peak load obtained in the process is then correlated to the concrete compressive strength. In determining an appropriate and robust configuration for the PSP test, commercially available screws of different sizes were investigated along with different sizes of drilled hole. High strength correlation of the PSP test in mortar with selected test configuration reveals the potential of the test to be used in the strength assessment. Further investigations are proposed to confirm the suitability of the test to be applied in concrete.",17,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101658,https://openalex.org/W3044476624,Tasks: strength

A unit of arrayed accelerometers is installed to detect multi-channel signal waveforms in the frequency domain. The resonant frequencies due to reflections at each node in 3D lattice nodes are computed by using the distances from elastic wave input to multiple output locations. The amplitudes corresponding to the resonant frequencies in the spectrum are summed up as the reflection intensity of elastic wave at each node. The reflection intensity distribution is visualized finally in the targeted area three-dimensionally.

The aim of the research was to evaluate the interfacial bond properties between a deteriorated normal strength concrete structure and a thin overlay made of Eco-UHPC containing 50 wt% of limestone filler. Two types of formwork were used: untreated rough plywood and surface treated shuttering plywood. The normal strength concrete elements were surface scaled using water jets to obtain some degradation prior to casting of the UHPC overlay. Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), bond test (pull-off test), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) were used for analysis. Elements repaired with the Eco-UHPC showed significantly improved mechanical properties compared to the non-deteriorated NSC sample which was used as a reference. The bond strength varied between 2 and 2.7 MPa regardless of the used formwork. The interfacial transition zone was very narrow with only slightly increased porosity. The untreated plywood, having a rough and water-absorbing surface, created a surface friction-based restraint which limited microcracking due to autogenous shrinkage. Shuttering plywood with a smooth surface enabled the development of higher tensile stress on the UHPC surface, which led to a more intensive autogenous shrinkage cracking. None of the formed microcracks penetrated through the entire thickness of the overlay and some were partly self-healed when a simple water treatment was applied. The project results showed that application of UHPC as repair material for concrete structures could elongate the lifespan and thus enhance the sustainability.",16,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13245778,https://openalex.org/W3111856399,Tasks: deterioration

When a structure ages, it is necessary to know its state of health and make a decision of maintenance or replacement. When a structure such as a bridge or building is subjected to destructive environmental forces, determining its state of health becomes a priority since its recovery is urgently required to function normally. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a technology that aims to prevent the collapse of structures and loss of human life through early diagnosis of the health status of a structure. There are a large number of damage detection methods that can be classified into (1) non-destructive testing methods, (2) dynamic characteristics-based damage detection methods, (3) dynamic response-based, (4) multi-scale damage detection method and (5) damage detection methods with consideration of uncertainties.

Of all the bond strength models considered from various literatures, the neural network model provided the most satisfactory prediction results in good agreement with the bond strength values obtained from the experiment. The UPV parameter was found to be one of the most significant predictors in the neural network model having a relative importance of 20.57%.

To evaluate the F-T resistance of adhesive interfaces in new-to-old concrete with a nondestructive method, this experiment was conducted with ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). Specimens with the same natural roughness were obtained using three-dimension printing technology. The surface roughness was measured via the sand replacement method. The traditional evaluation that the decrease of relative dynamic elastic modulus under 60 % represents the failure of concrete F-T resistance has a limitation in new-to-old concrete structures. A new characterization method of F-T resistance in adhesive interface for new-to-old concrete was proposed based on the variation trend of UPV in parallel direction (UPV-PD) and vertical direction (UPV-VD). The UPV-VD loss ratio had a three-stage characteristic and a steady phase, which was different from the loss ratio of splitting tensile strength in numerical value. The results showed that the UPV-PD loss ratio grew linearly in the process of F-T cycles. Moisture content was the dominant influence on the numerical difference. This difference can be eliminated based on a correction method. The variation trend of the UPV loss ratio in adhesive interfaces was similar to that of splitting tensile strength, and the obvious turning points appeared after similar F-T cycles.

Some microbes like Bacillus subtilis which have the properties of bio-calcification can precipitate CaCO3 effectively inside concrete structures. This CaCO3 precipitation can fill the pores and therefore, the cracks internally and finally make the structure more compact.

Fire resistance of corroded high-strength structural concrete,Khaled Sobhan; D. V.

The exposure to fire can further deteriorate the structural integrity of corroded concrete structures. This combined effect of corrosion damage and fire exposure is not generally addressed in the structural concrete design codes. The synergistic combination of the effects of corrosion and fire forms the basis of this paper. Design/methodology/approach Concrete beam specimens with different strengths were prepared, moist-cured and corroded with impressed current. Later, they were “crack-scored” for corrosion evaluation, after which half were exposed to fire in a gas kiln. The fire damage was evaluated by nondestructive testing using ultrasonic pulse velocity. Next, all specimens were tested for residual flexural strength. They were then autopsied, and the level of corrosion was determined based on mass loss of the reinforcement. Findings For corroded specimens, the flexural capacity loss because of fire exposure increases as the compressive strength increases. In general, the higher the crack score, the higher the corresponding mass loss, unless some partial/segmental debonding of the reinforcement occurred. The degree of corrosion increases with decreasing compressive strength. The residual moment capacity, based on analytically determined capacities of uncorroded and nonfire-exposed beams, was significantly lower than those of uncorroded beams exposed to fire. Originality/value The combined effects of corrosion and fire on the mechanical properties of structural concrete are relatively unknown, and no guidance is available in the existing design codes to address this issue.

For these purposes, a reinforced concrete slab specimen (1000 mm (width) by 5000 mm (length) by 210 mm (thickness)) was fabricated in the laboratory. Heat damage in the concrete slab specimen was induced by exposing the bottom of the specimen to the temperatures corresponding to the standard fire curve described in the ASTM E 119 for 3 h. Impact-echo testing was performed on the bottom surface of the concrete slab specimen before and after inducing the fire damage. It was observed that the spectral responses of the fire-damaged concrete were dominated by several non-propagating waves, which resulted in main peak frequencies around 4500 Hz and 5100 Hz. A discrete layered concrete damage model developed in this study was used to reconstruct the variation of the P-wave velocity with the depth of the fire-damaged concrete. It was demonstrated that the predicted P-wave velocity profile using the simplified model showed a good agreement with the measured values from the five core samples, which measured 100 mm (diameter) by 200 mm (height) cylinders, using ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) measurements at eight different depths. In addition, the peak frequencies predicted by the simplified model were consistent with the measured peak frequencies. The experimental results in this study demonstrated that IE testing is effective for evaluating the post-fire damage of reinforced concrete slabs. Particularly, the simplified model in this study can be effective for better interpreting the spectral responses of fire-damaged concrete slabs by IE testing.",6,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20205838,https://openalex.org/W3093410077,Tasks: defects
Magnetic Data Pattern Features at Longitudinal Defect Sites in Rebars Scanned by a Passive Magnetic Inspection Technology,Milad Mosharafi; SeyedBijan Mahbaz; Maurice B. Dusseault,2020,10.32389/jeeg20-031,Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics,"ABSTRACT Reinforced concrete is a versatile modern construction material. Despite its advantages as a composite material, corrosion of the embedded reinforcing steel leads to infrastructure deterioration and loss of service. Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods are required to quantify the reinforcement condition, and to help manage human and financial risks arising from unexpected outright failure or service restrictions. Reinforcement condition can be assessed using a novel, time- and cost-efficient NDT method based on the self-magnetic behaviour of ferromagnetic materials. In this study, the magnetic properties of three similar rebars, each having three similar sized longitudinal defects, are recorded and assessed through experiments and a numerical simulation model. Strong correspondence is demonstrated between the magnetic properties from numerical simulation and from the experimental objects. For instance, applying the experimentally obtained defect detection threshold to the mathematically simulated results allows accurate defect detection in the simulations, showing that self-magnetic behavior is a powerful tool for condition assessment of ferromagnetic reinforcing materials.",6,article,False,https://doi.org/10.32389/jeeg20-031,https://openalex.org/W3116817831,Tasks: defects
Wood Density and Moisture Content Estimation by Drilling Chips Extraction Technique,Roberto D. Martínez; José-Antonio Balmori; Daniel F. Llana; Ignacio Bobadilla Maldonado,2020,10.3390/ma13071699,Materials,"The novelty of this study is the development of an accurate wood moisture content (MC) estimation method based on a relatively brand-new, non-destructive testing technique (drilling chips extraction). The method is especially important in the assessment of existing timber structures, where non-destructive testing (NDT) results are affected by wood MC and should be adjusted to a reference MC, usually 12%. In the assessment of timber structures, it is not possible to determine MC by oven drying method and this should be estimated. Electrical resistance and capacitance are the conventional methods used for MC estimation. This research work aims to present an accurate MC estimation method based on the drilling chips extraction technique. For that, 99 specimens (90 × 65 × 38 mm3) from three softwood and hardwood species covering a wide range of densities (from 355 to 978 kg m−3) were tested after conditioning at five different MCs (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%). The Wood Extractor device based on the drilling chips extraction technique was used. The mass of the chips collected (drilling residue) from each drill was recorded. The results show that the MC of the chips extracted was statistically significantly different than the MC of the specimen and cannot be directly used as MC determination. However, the chips MC can be used as an estimator of specimen MC with high determination coefficients (R2 from 71% to 86%). As the main result, models to estimate density directly adjusted to a reference 12% MC from the wet and dry mass of chips extracted were developed with an R2 of 98%. In sum, the drilling chips extractor is a dependable and straightforward method to estimate MC and density from only one measurement. Density adjusted to a reference 12% MC can be directly estimated from a single model.",6,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13071699,https://openalex.org/W3014612893,Tasks: moisture
Polyester Polymer Concrete for Bridge Deck Overlays,Robert Stevens; W. Spencer Guthrie,2020,,ScholarsArchive  (Brigham Young University),"The objectives of this research were to 1) compile a synthesis of information about polyester polymer concrete (PPC) from the literature; 2) conduct a scanning tour to observe PPC construction, inspect in-service PPC overlays, and discuss topics related to PPC; 3) revise the existing Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) PPC specification; 4) document a PPC field demonstration project; and 5) perform laboratory characterization of the material properties of field-mixed PPC. The scope of the research included a scanning tour, field testing, and laboratory experimentation. The objectives of the scanning tour included observation of a PPC overlay placement, inspection of existing overlays, and discussion of selected topics related to PPC. The scanning tour comprised a 3-day visit to California. Items related to material properties, mixture and overlay design, laboratory testing, and construction and field testing were investigated. Several recommendations relevant to Utah bridge deck preservation practice were developed based on the findings and then incorporated into a revised UDOT PPC specification. The objective of the field testing was to evaluate specific aspects of construction, quality assurance, and performance of PPC overlays on concrete bridge decks. The scope of the project included testing of a PPC test section overlay and three PPC bridge deck overlays during and after construction. Hardness tests were performed on the test section placements, and hardness, skid resistance, impact-echo, impedance, and resin content determination tests were performed on each of the bridge deck overlays. The field testing yielded valuable information about PPC overlays. Recommendations regarding hardness testing, skid resistance testing, patching, and surface preparation were developed based on the findings. The objectives of the laboratory experimentation were to characterize several material properties of field-mixed PPC sampled from actual bridge deck overlay placements in Utah and compare them to properties of laboratory-mixed PPC reported in the literature. Laboratory testing was conducted on a typical PPC mixture. Properties that were measured include density, modulus of elasticity, coefficient of thermal expansion, hardness, unconfined compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, rapid chloride permeability, and resin content. Measured properties were consistent with typical ranges cited in the literature.",5,article,True,https://openalex.org/W3021950047,https://openalex.org/W3021950047,Tasks: strength

Assessment of the Condition of an Existing Marine Concrete Structure in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria,Sylvester Osuji; Okiemute Roland Ogirigbo; Felix Utse-Oritselaju Atakere,2020,,Journal of Civil Engineering Research,"Chloride induced reinforcement corrosion is the major cause of premature deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in the chloride-laden Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This study evaluated the extent of deterioration of an existing 45 years old concrete quay structure. The methodology adopted for the study includes conducting a visual inspection on the structure to determine the current condition of the structure and the nature of testing required. Next, several non-destructive tests were carried out to determine the compressive strength, nature of corrosion and the impact on the structure. Water samples were also collected for chemical analysis, to ascertain the corrosion inducing compounds present in the surrounding seawater. The results indicated that the quay structure suffered from chloride-induced corrosion, imposed by the surrounding seawater. Measurement of the level of corrosion carried out on steel reinforcement samples obtained from the quay showed a high-level of corrosion, with rates of 0.65 uA/cm3, evident by an average weight loss of 47% per meter length of steel. Compressive strength obtained via rebound hammer test showed average concrete strength loss of 28% from the original as-built strength of 40 N/mm2. The results showed that the rate of corrosion and strength deterioration depended on the nature and length of exposure. Elements of the structure that were exposed to tidal exposure conditions experienced greater levels of deterioration compared to elements that were continuously submerged.",5,article,True,https://openalex.org/W3118712696,https://openalex.org/W3118712696,Tasks: strength
Revised Rebound Hammer and Pull‐Out Test Strength Curves for Fiber‐Reinforced Concrete,Peng Deng; Yan Sun; Yan Liu; Xiaoxiao Song,2020,10.1155/2020/8263745,Advances in Civil Engineering,"Rebound hammer tests and postinstalled pull‐out tests are commonly used for evaluating the compressive strength of ordinary concrete, and the strength of concrete is estimated by strength curves. However, using these strength curves to predict the compressive strength of carbon fiber‐reinforced concrete (CFRC), polypropylene fiber‐reinforced concrete (PFRC), and carbon‐polypropylene hybrid fiber‐reinforced concrete (HFRC) may lead to considerable uncertainties. Therefore, this study revises the strength curves derived from rebound hammer tests and postinstalled pull‐out tests for ordinary concrete. 480 specimens of fiber‐reinforced concrete (FRC) of six strength grades are examined. Standard cube compressive strength tests are used as a reference, and the results of various regression models are compared.

Investigation of factors affecting core compressive strength and non-destructive testing of concrete,Nihat Kabay; Fevziye Aköz,2020,,,"This paper investigates several factors such as the effect of drilling, moisture content and presence of reinforcement on the compressive strength of core samples and the effect of reinforcement and concrete age on the rebound number and ultrasonic pulse velocity of concrete. Test results show that the effect of moisture on core strength was lower than the other factors. Due to the drilling effect, the core compressive strength was reduced by 11%. The presence and the number of reinforcement in core samples significantly affected the compressive strength. On average, the reduction in strength of cores that contain single and two bars was found as 12% and 16% respectively. The rebound number and ultrasonic pulse velocity values increased with the age of concrete. The reinforcement did not have a significant effect on the non-destructive test results.

The measurements were performed with commercial devices. It was found that all devices are applicable for field inspections.

Effect of utilizing geopolymer fly ash on potential and corrosion rate of reinforcement in high-strength concrete,Teuku Budi Aulia; M Muttaqin; Mochammad Afifuddin; Muhammad Zaki; Firdaus Firdaus,2020,10.1088/1757-899x/933/1/012047,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,"Abstract With the increasing use of high-strength reinforced concretes as a structural element of construction, their resistance to corrosion in environmental conditions needs to be studied. It is well known that cement manufacturing at plants is un-environmental friendly due to plenty of fuel consumption and CO2 emission to the atmosphere leading to greenhouse effect. Therefore, substituting cement with environmentally friendly natural materials and natural wastes become a smart solution. This study aims to measure the potential level and corrosion rate of reinforcing steel in high-strength concrete with variations in cement replacement by geopolymer fly ash, environmental conditions, and concrete covering thickness. Corrosion potential measurement was carried out with the half-cell potential mapping method, while the corrosion rate used the linear polarization resistance method. Data collection was executed every two weeks during eight weeks of immersion. High-strength concrete beams with compressive strength target 70 MPa having dimension 15cm x 20cm x 80cm were substituted with 15% coal fly ash (CFA), 15% palm oil blast furnace slag fly ash (POSFA), and 10% pozzolanic fly ash (PFA) from cement weight.

The concrete covering thickness was 2 cm and 4 cm. Immersion medium uses artificial seawater (3.5% NaCl) and shallow well water. The results showed that specimens resulting in the lowest corrosion rate were PFA, CFA, POSFA, and HSCWFA respectively. Corrosion potential was obtained at low to medium levels, while corrosion rates were at low corrosion level criteria.

Quantitative Assessment of Alkali-Silica Reaction in Small and Large-Scale Concrete Specimens Utilizing Nonlinear Acoustic Techniques,Clayton Malone,2020,,Lincoln (University of Nebraska),"Nonlinear resonance techniques have been shown to be sensitive to microcracking in materials, including alkali-silica reaction (ASR) damage in concrete. However, application of nonlinear resonance tests have been limited due to the difficulty of application to large-scale field structures and the inability to quantitatively relate material nonlinearity with damage development. In this study, the development of ASR in concrete prisms and large concrete beam specimens of varying aggregate types and specimen sizes was monitored using linear and nonlinear resonance techniques.\nFor the concrete prisms, although the linear resonance frequency test could detect initiation and development of ASR damage in specimens with the reactive coarse aggregate, it failed in the specimens with the reactive fine aggregate. As a comparison, the nonlinear resonance test results not only detected the initiation of ASR damage for specimens of both reactive aggregate types, but also showed a strong correlation with ASR damage progression.\nA nonlinear impact-echo (IE) method was proposed for concrete damage evaluation on large structures. The nonlinear IE method is similar to the nonlinear resonance test, but it excites the local thickness resonance mode. The method was validated on various beam specimens and the results demonstrate that the nonlinear IE method is more sensitive than the linear IE test and can be used for damage evaluation of large-scale concrete structures. The nonlinear results from the prisms and beam specimens were used to form quantitative relationships between expansion and material nonlinearity that can be used to assess ASR damage without a baseline (initial) measurement.\nAdvisors: Jinying Zhu and Jiong Hu",2,article,True,https://openalex.org/W3047929786,https://openalex.org/W3047929786,Tasks: deterioration
Bridges structural health monitoring (SHM) with aid of building information modeling (BIM) and remote sensing technologies,Daniel Rodriguez Polania,2020,,,"Damage detection and characterization of structures is a key aspect in the field of civil engineering. Structures already constructed as well as new structures should be periodically monitored in order identify possible appearance of new damage and obtain reliable information about its integrity. These monitoring procedures should be applied periodically in time in order to instruct rapid repair treatments and guarantee safety to its users. Following this needs, the Structural Health monitoring (SHM) arises as a process of damage detection and characterization in structures with technologies such as sensors, non-destructive testing, etc. or with simple techniques such as visual inspections.    Given the fact that SHM processes leads to a collection of a vast and variable quantity of data about a structure, the Building Information Modeling (BIM) is starting to gain relevance in this context, as it has already shown its utility to store and manage different type of data during the design stages of a structure.    On specific, the field of heritage building information modeling (HBIM) presents a solution to create accurate models of existing structures. This field uses remote sensing technologies such as laser scanning and photogrammetry for surveying the structures in order to detect its main characteristics with an accurate level of detail.    The aim of this study is to present how remote sensing techniques can be used in the context of HBIM and subsequently the HBIM model can be used as a tool for SHM. With this purpose, this research tests the applicability of these methodologies in two real study cases.   On the first part of this research, beams from the superstructure and from the pier cap of an already dismantled overpass bridge were modeled in BIM software parametrically and with a semi-direct importation from a photogrammetric model. Damage information already recovered from these elements was then transferred into the BIM platform. As a second step of the research, a complete survey of the first span of an existing bridge was done and a 3D model of the structure was created. Then, the process of semi-direct importation from the remote sensing software to the BIM platform was applied. Finally, a user interface was created inside the BIM software so that an operator can characterize and classify the damage directly inside the model, following the approach given by new guidelines from the Italian authorities.     The results of this study show that the modeling of existing structures for SHM using BIM software is possible and can produce a useful tool keep control of existing structures. However, this research also demonstrates that as some compatibility problems between remote sensing and BIM software still exists, the great potential of the combination of these tools for SHM purposes implies significant manual work and that future research on this field is a crucial aspect to initiate developing this methodology as a standard for existing structures.",2,article,False,https://openalex.org/W3184746556,https://openalex.org/W3184746556,Tasks: defects
Influence of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Wraps on Corrosion Progression of Bridge Piles in Marine Environments,Shayan Yazdani,2020,,Digital Commons - University of South Florida (University of South Florida),"The Friendship Trail Bridge connecting Tampa to St. Petersburg was demolished in 2016. Thirteen 20 inches. by 20 inches. reinforced concrete piles supporting its superstructure were part of research studies conducted between 2004 and 2008 to explore the role of glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) in corrosion repair. During demolition, piles were typically cut at the pile cap and in the splash zone. The resulting segments varied in length between 3 to 4 ft. These remnants were transported to the University of South Florida (USF) campus for postmortem analysis. The overarching goal was to establish the role of GFRP in reducing the corrosion rate in steel. Eight piles were selected for the postmortem study. Two were unrepaired controls. Of the remaining six, one was wrapped in 2004, two in 2006 and three in 2008. Except for the 2004 repair that had six glass layers, all piles had two glass layers extending over the entire pile segment that had been retrieved. The piles were left outdoors at USF and postmortem studies initiated in March 2018. Following delamination and spall survey, the glass fiber wraps were carefully removed, and non-destructive studies initiated. They consisted of half-cell potential measurements, resistivity measurements, and cover-depth measurement using ground penetrating radar (GPR). Subsequently, chloride samples were extracted from the pile cap along lengths of 1 ft and 3 ft at five different depths to the rebar in accordance with ASTM C1152 to determine the total chloride content. The segments were then destroyed, and eight bars retrieved from each of the eight piles. The profile of each of the 64 bars were measured in 120-degree directions along the circumference at every 5 inches using a digital caliper. Metal loss was calculated at each measured location and the highest loss was in one of the controls at 9.2%. Losses were generally below 5%. This was because the chloride concentration at the level of the rebar was below the critical threshold.",1,article,False,https://openalex.org/W3217128211,https://openalex.org/W3217128211,Tasks: deterioration

Effect of Adding Carbon Nanotubes on Corrosion Rates and Steel-Concrete Bond,Ahmed M. Hassan; Hala Elkady; Ibrahim G. Shaaban,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-42761-2,Scientific Reports,"Abstract This paper presents a continuation of the evaluation of utilizing Nano Carbon Tubes (CNTs) in reinforced concrete (CNT-CRETE). The compressive, tensile and bond strengths of the samples with and without CNTs were investigated. Scanning Electron Microscope (SME) was utilized to study the microstructure of the prepared samples. In addition, the corrosion resistance of CNT-CRETE, was measured and compared to traditional concrete. Four mixes were prepared, with 0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.03%, CNTs by weight of cement, along with a control mix without CNTs. The results of the experimental work showed that adding CNTs led to an increase in the compressive, tensile and bond strengths of specimens compared to those of the control specimen. SEM examination for control and CNTs specimens showed that CNTs specimen were well structured compared with the control specimen and this affirms that CNTs act as bridges across micro cracks, which explains the improvement in mechanical properties. The diameter of steel bars played a significant role in failure mechanism for pull-out testing and corrosion resistance. In general, adding CNTs to the concrete mix increased the rate of corrosion for steel bars within the low risk limits. Benefits from using CNTs were limited to moderate. Mineral/chemical admixtures or fibers provide better improvements in the mechanical properties of concrete without the problems associated with dispersing CNTs and the health hazard of handling a Nano material.",73,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-42761-2,https://openalex.org/W2939220699,Tasks: deterioration
Influence of cellulose fiber addition on self-healing and water permeability of concrete,Harshbab Singh; Rishi Gupta,2019,10.1016/j.cscm.2019.e00324,Case Studies in Construction Materials,"Crack formation under tensile forces is a major weakness of concrete. Cracks make concrete vulnerable to extreme environment due to ingress of water and harmful compounds from surrounding environment. Even though concrete is susceptible to cracking it has ability to seal its crack by itself to some extent due to autogenous self-healing. So far only few studies have been done on autogenous healing of fiber reinforced concrete. So, this study aims to evaluate the self-healing potential and water permeability of cellulose fiber reinforced concrete (CeFRC). The two types of composites; control and cellulose fiber reinforced concrete have been investigated. Compressive strength and flexural tests were performed to measure the mechanical properties of the composites, water permeability and the self-healing performance was investigated by using ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and a patented self-healing test. The results indicate that the water permeability coefficient decreased by 42% whereas the healing ratio increased at a higher rate for the initial days of healing when cellulose fibers were added in the mix. CeFRC also results in a 7.8% increase in the flexural strength and demonstrate a higher self-healing ratio based on the UPV test.",73,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2019.e00324,https://openalex.org/W2995095329,Tasks: strength
Early Crack Detection of Reinforced Concrete Structure Using Embedded Sensors,Joyraj Chakraborty; Andrzej Katunin; Piotr Klikowicz; Marek Salamak,2019,10.3390/s19183879,Sensors,"The damage in reinforced concrete (RC) structures can be induced either by the dynamic or static load. The inspection technologies available today have difficulty in detecting slowly progressive, locally limited damage, especially in hard-to-reach areas in the superstructure. The four-point bending test on the benchmark RC structure was used as a test of the quality and sensitivity of the embedded sensors. It allowed assessment of whether any cracking and propagation that occurs with the embedded sensors can be detected. Various methods are used for the analysis of the ultrasonic signals. By determining the feature from the ultrasonic signals, the changes in the whole structure are evaluated. The structural degradation of the RC benchmark structure was tested using various non-destructive testing methods to obtain a comprehensive decision about structural condition. It is shown that the ultrasonic sensors can detect a crack with a probability of detection of 100%, also before it is visible by the naked eye and other techniques, even if the damage is not in the direct path of the ultrasonic wave. The obtained results confirmed that early crack detection is possible using the developed methodology based on embedded and external sensors and advanced signal processing.",69,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19183879,https://openalex.org/W2972023353,Tasks: defects
Applicability of GPR and a rebar detector to obtain rebar information of existing concrete structures,Harsh Rathod; Scott Debeck; Rishi Gupta; Brian G.

There are several old reinforced concrete slab bridges within the network of Ministry of Forests in B.C. Canada that have unknown rebar spacing, cover and diameter. This research paper discusses the application of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and a Rebar detector in obtaining valuable information about rebar diameter, spacing and cover depth required to determine the structural capacity (load rating) of bridge decks. For this, GPR and the rebar detector have been applied on an existing bridge deck, a precast bridge girder and a reinforced concrete test slab panel available in the materials lab at the Facility for Innovative Materials and Infrastructure Monitoring (FIMIM) at the University of Victoria (UVic). To assess the applicability of GPR and Profoscope (Rebar Detector) in obtaining rebar information, the results obtained using both the techniques were compared in terms of their errors in determining all three parameters of rebar; diameter, spacing and cover depth.

Quantitative Attribute Analyses with Ground Penetrating Radar for Infrastructure Assessments and Structural Health Monitoring,Isabel Morris; Hiba Abdel‐Jaber; Branko Glišić,2019,10.3390/s19071637,Sensors,"In civil structures and infrastructure, assessing true performance and characterizing unusual structural behaviors can help avoid severe structural problems. To further refine or validate the conclusions from structural health monitoring (SHM) analyses, nondestructive evaluation or techniques (NDE or NDT) can be applied in conjunction with SHM approaches. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an NDT that has been used to investigate defects and internal features in concrete structures, but is not commonly used to assess mechanical properties for the purposes of SHM. As a preliminary investigation of the effectiveness of attribute analysis techniques, a GPR survey was conducted on Streicker Bridge (a pedestrian bridge on Princeton University campus with embedded fiber-optic strain and temperature sensors). The bridge was constructed in two phases, where different curing conditions produced different material properties (compressive strength of 51 MPa and 59 MPa). Both standard processing techniques and attribute analysis techniques were employed to interpret GPR reflections in each phase of construction to identify construction elements and to compare the attribute signatures of different strength concretes.Though this study presents primarily relative differences, the sensitivity of these attributes to material property differences is confirmed. This validates SHM studies of the bridge and indicates the potential of the attribute analysis method for material characterization, especially as a compliment to other SHM and NDE techniques.",40,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19071637,https://openalex.org/W2928535876,Tasks: strength
Non-destructive data assimilation as a tool to diagnose corrosion rate in reinforced concrete structures,Olivier Anterrieu; Bernard Giroux; Erwan Gloaguen; Christophe Carde,2019,10.1016/j.jobe.2019.01.033,Journal of Building Engineering,"&lt;p&gt;La transcription des symboles et des caractères spéciaux utilisés dans la version originale de &#13;\nce résumé n’a pas été possible en raison de limitations techniques. La version correcte de ce &#13;\nrésumé peut être lue en PDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement corrosion is a major problem in the long-term management of reinforced concrete structures. With sustainability in perspective, knowledge of the corrosion rate (Vcor) makes it possible to estimate the kinetics of the corrosion phenomenon and helps in refining the maintenance strategy of such structures. Although in situ Vcor measurements are possible, data acquisition is time-consuming because of the protocol intrinsic to its measurement (reinforcement polarization made point by point). Therefore, in the context of site diagnostics, these methods cannot reasonably be used systematically on site and must be combined with high performance non-destructive testing (NDT) surface methods (GPR, capacimetry, half-cell corrosion). In addition, depending on the case, Vcor (point measurements) and NDT(surface) data are statistically related. However, there is a lack of efficient data assimilation tools permitting accurate translation of NDT data into pseudo Vcor data. In this paper, we present a numerical tool allowing prediction of Vcor values from NDT measurements. The tool permits application of different data assimilation techniques, i.e., cokriging, Bayesian sequential simulation, and a decision tree-driven learning depending on statistical behavior and available data. The efficiency of our numerical tool has been tested on a dataset acquired on a structure located in the French Alps. Results show that, for the case study, our data assimilation tool allows prediction of Vcor with accuracy compared to in situ measurements and also permits one to infer the uncertainty of the prediction. This opens the door for quantitative use of multiple NDT in the management of reinforced concrete structures.&lt;/p&gt;",32,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2019.01.033,https://openalex.org/W2912001378,Tasks: deterioration
Mechanical and Acoustic Emission Behavior of Gangue Concrete under Uniaxial Compression,Meng Xiao; Feng Ju; Pai Ning; Kaiyuan Li,2019,10.3390/ma12203318,Materials,"The application of gangue concrete can be an effective method to solve the massive gangue heap and shortage of raw materials of concrete by replacing the gravel and river sand with crushed gangue. An Acoustic emission (AE) is one of the non-destructive testing methods that can be used for damage detection of the gangue concrete structure. However, there are obvious mechanics differences between gangue and gravel/river sand, so the previous analysis methods of AE signal for concrete structure detection, mainly applied to ordinary concrete, are not suitable for gangue concrete. Based on this, the physical and mechanical characteristics of coal gangue were studied, and the uniaxial compressive test, along with AE monitoring of gangue concrete, was conducted in this paper. The differences in AE behavior between gangue concrete and ordinary concrete were also analyzed. The mechanical test result shows that the compressive strength of gangue concrete can reach 35–40 MPa. Comparing with ordinary concrete, gangue concrete has larger initial porosity and abrupt rupture. Additionally, the accumulative energy growth rate of gangue concrete has two peak values before the peak load, while ordinary concrete only has one. This difference can be used to forecast damage of gangue concrete structure by AE technology. This paper shows the possibility of making concrete by coal gangue, and the possibility of identifying its damage degree with the use of acoustic emission technology.",30,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma12203318,https://openalex.org/W2980056066,"Tasks: strength, defects"
Evaluation of Self-Compacting Concrete Strength with Non-Destructive Tests for Concrete Structures,Miguel Nepomuceno; Luís Filipe Almeida Bernardo,2019,10.3390/app9235109,Applied Sciences,"Self-compacting concrete (SCC) shows to have some specificities when compared to normal vibrated concrete (NVC), namely higher cement paste dosage and smaller volume of coarse aggregates. In addition, the maximum size of coarse aggregates is also reduced in SCC to prevent blocking effect. Such specificities are likely to affect the results of non-destructive tests when compared to those obtained in NVC with similar compressive strength and materials. This study evaluates the applicability of some non-destructive tests to estimate the compressive strength of SCC. Selected tests included the ultrasonic pulse velocity test (PUNDIT), the surface hardness test (Schmidt rebound hammer type N), the pull-out test (Lok-test), and the concrete maturity test (COMA-meter). Seven sets of SCC specimens were produced in the laboratory from a single mixture and subjected to standard curing. The tests were applied at different ages, namely: 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 94 days. The concrete compressive strength ranged from 45 MPa (at 24 h) to 97 MPa (at 94 days). Correlations were established between the non-destructive test results and the concrete compressive strength.

"Effect of Vietnamese Fly Ash on Selected Physical Properties, Durability and Probability of Corrosion of Steel in Concrete",Chinh Van Nguyen; Paul Lambert; Tran Quang Hung,2019,10.3390/ma12040593,Materials,"Vietnamese fly ash was used as a partial replacement for ordinary Portland cement in the proportions of 10%, 20% and 40%, while the water to cementitious ratios were kept constant at 0.42, 0.5 and 0.55, respectively, for three groups. The compressive strengths of all mixes were determined up to 90 days. The acid resistance of fly ash concrete was examined by the mass loss and compressive strength loss of 100 × 100 × 100 mm3 cubes immersed in a 10% H2SO4 solution. The probability of steel corrosion in the fly ash concrete was assessed by measuring the half-cell potentials of steel bars within beams dimensions of 100 × 100 × 500 mm3, and the flexural strengths of these beams after 300 days of immersion in a 5% NaCl solution were determined. The results demonstrate that the compressive strength of fly ash concrete is reduced at an early age but increases as the concrete continues to hydrate. The fly ash increases the sulfuric acid resistance of concrete. Fly ash additions have only a limited effect on reducing the risk of probability of corrosion of steel in the concrete. The load capacities of 10% and 20% fly ash reinforced concrete beams are higher than that of the control beams after 300 days immersed in a 5% NaCl solution.",29,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma12040593,https://openalex.org/W2911835568,Tasks: strength
Characteristic Curve and Its Use in Determining the Compressive Strength of Concrete by the Rebound Hammer Test,Dalibor Kocáb; Petr Misák; Petr Cikrle,2019,10.3390/ma12172705,Materials,"During the construction of concrete structures, it is often useful to know compressive strength at an early age. This is an amount of strength required for the safe removal of formwork, also known as stripping strength. It is certainly helpful to determine this strength non-destructively, i.e., without any invasive steps that would damage the structure. Second only to the ultrasonic pulse velocity test, the rebound hammer test is the most common NDT method currently used for this purpose. However, estimating compressive strength using general regression models can often yield inaccurate results. The experiment results show that the compressive strength of any concrete can be estimated using one’s own newly created regression model. A traditionally constructed regression model can predict the strength value with 50% reliability, or when two-sided confidence bands are used, with 95% reliability. However, civil engineers usually work with the so-called characteristic value defined as a 5% quantile. Therefore, it appears suitable to adjust conventional methods in order to achieve a regression model with 95% one-sided reliability. This paper describes a simple construction of such a characteristic curve. The results show that the characteristic curve created for the concrete in question could be a useful tool even outside of practical applications.",25,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma12172705,https://openalex.org/W2969665358,Tasks: strength

Microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) occurs naturally in the presence of ureolytic bacteria which precipitate calcium carbonate (CaCO3) through urea hydrolysis. This deposition leads to the filling of micro-cracks and sealing of pores, reducing ingress of fluids into the concrete. The research aims were to assess the potential of Lysinibacillus sphaericus for healing cracks in concrete and to study the effects of this treatment on the absorption properties of treated concrete. Lysinibacillus sphaericus was cultivated in vitro and induction of MICP through urea hydrolysis was tested on cement paste with two different calcium sources. The calcium precipitates where characterized by light microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The final phase of the study involved testing of the crack healing capacity and the effect on absorption of the MICP process on mortar samples. These parameters were measured by means of visual examinations, light and digital microscopy, Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV), and absorption tests. The study confirmed that MICP is induced successfully on concrete using Lysinibacillus sphaericus. Samples exposed to repeated treatment cycles of Lysinibacillus sphaericus in the presence of a calcium source, exhibited a more extensive and even coating of CaCO3 crystals on the surface confirming that repeated cycles of treatment are more effective in increasing the amount of CaCO3 deposition and therefore increasing crack healing capacity. Digital microscopy and UPV analysis proved that this precipitate was successful in partially healing cracks in samples. Sorptivity tests confirmed this and showed that it was also successful as a surface treatment to reduce absorption.",23,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2019.00062,https://openalex.org/W2943773904,Tasks: deterioration

Industrial chimneys are often exposed to the strong action of acidic substances, They are negatively exposed to the condensation of the flue gases. Condensate affects the inside of the thermal insulation and penetrates the chimney wall from the outside. This is one reason for the corrosion of concrete and reinforcing steel. Wet thermal insulation settles, and drastically reduces its insulating properties. This leads to an increase in temperature in the reinforced concrete chimney wall and creates additional large variations in temperature fields. This consequently causes a large increase in internal forces, which mainly increase tensile and shear stresses. This results in the appearance of additional cracks in the wall. The acid condensate penetrates these cracks, destroying the concrete cover and reinforcement. Thermographic studies are very helpful in monitoring the changes in temperature and consequently, the risk of concrete and reinforcement corrosion. This simple implication between changes in temperature of the chimney wall and increasing inner forces as shown in this article is particularly important when the chimney cannot be switched off due to the nature of the production process.

Cement, river sand, Bama gravel and water in standard proportion in accordance to BS1881 Part 101 were mixed to produce beams, slabs and cubes of different sizes and cured for 28 days. The samples were burnt in a designed fire simulation furnace using sugarcane bagasse as fuel with varying air velocities for 2 hours. Cooling of samples was carried out using water splashing, CO2 powder fire extinguisher and air cooling methods before the compressive strength tests using a Seidner Compressive Testing Machine and Non-destructive test with Rebound Hammer.

Wave propagation and scattering in reinforced concrete beams,Evelyne El Masri; N.S.

Such damage is generally invisible and non-destructive testing methods are needed to assess their integrity. Guided wave methods are popular because they are capable of detecting damage using sensors placed remotely from the damage site, which is often unknown. This paper predicts free wave propagation in RC beams from which the concept of a guided wave based damage detection method emerges. The wave solutions are obtained using the wave finite element framework where a short section of a beam's cross section is modeled in conventional finite element (FE) and periodic boundary conditions are subsequently applied. Reinforcement elements are used in the FE model of the cross section as a neat and efficient means of coupling the concrete to the rebars and imposing prestress. The results show that prestress, important for static behavior, has a negligible effect on wave dispersion. A RC beam with a damaged section is modeled by coupling three waveguides, the center waveguide being identical to the outer ones except for a thickness loss in one rebar. Only small differences in cut-on frequencies are observed between the damaged and undamaged sections. However, these small differences give rise to strong reflection of some waves at frequencies close to cut-on. Below cut-on, most incident power is transmitted but experiences wave mode conversion, whereas above cut-on most power is transmitted to the same wave type. These observations form the basis for ongoing work to develop a damage detection technique premised on wave reflection near cut-on.",13,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5131644,https://openalex.org/W2984583714,Tasks: defects

Performance Evaluation and Crack Repair in Building Infrastructure,Adi Susetyo Dermawan; Sri Murni Dewi; Wisnumurti Wisnumurti; Ari Wibowo,2019,10.1088/1755-1315/328/1/012007,IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science,"Abstract The implementation of building infrastructure development to improve people’s lives is important. The use of reinforced concrete structures has increased very rapidly. But many buildings are failed and are not safe because of overloading, changes in function and configuration of buildings, poor maintenance, and natural disasters. Many methods developed to reduce the damage caused by earthquakes so that the development of methods to strengthen and repair building structures is needed to anticipate damage to buildings. This study focuses on beam-column joint cracks with simple building characteristics, column size 20/20 and beam 15/20 (monolithic) with concrete quality fc’= 21 MPa, so it is necessary to evaluate and repair beam-column joint cracks in buildings because of overload. The method used was experimental and testing in a laboratory with a single static load and Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) test to determine the density after repair. Test specimens are SK (control-specimens) and SK-repairing. The results showed that the beam-column joint performance before and after repairs had relatively the same flexural strength of 1,669 kg and 1,686 kg, while the stiffness was lower at 14.48%. The velocity after repair average is 3,327.5 m/s (medium-category). The elasticity average modulus of the test is 20.43 GPa.",10,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/328/1/012007,https://openalex.org/W2981525798,Tasks: strength
Conservative characteristic strength of concrete from non-destructive and partially destructive testing,Saha Dauji; Sandip Bhalerao; P K Srivastava; Kapilesh Bhargava,2019,10.18702/acf.2019.06.30.25,Journal of Asian Concrete Federation,"In this article, the strategy for evaluation of conservative characteristic strength of concrete from the non-destructive and partially destructive testing on the existing structures is elucidated. Such evaluations becomes essential for health assessment and re-evaluation of the existing structures to fulfill the requirements of periodic assessment, revised loading, changed functionality, regulatory guidelines or post-accident scenario. The non-destructive tests considered were ultrasonic pulse velocity (USPV) and rebound hammer (RH) records. This started with examination of the dataset for outliers, and elimination of the same, if any. Subsequently, the forms of correlation expression best suited for evaluation of compressive strength from USPV and RH were ascertained from the limited number of combined records of USPV, RH and core strength obtained from the structure. Stratified sampling was adopted to divide the data into modeling and testing data for this exercise, the latter being employed for performance evaluation. From the results, it was concluded that for the dataset involved, linear equation would be best suited for evaluation of compressive strength from both USPV as well as RH. The total records of the USPV, RH and core results were thereafter employed to determine the correlation expressions, which were subsequently applied on the USPV and RH records from the entire structure to arrive at the estimates of equivalent cube strength. The conservative characteristic strength of concrete in the structure was suggested from considerations of Indian standard code and may be extended for other codes as well. The conservative characteristic strength of concrete can hereafter be utilized for health assessment and re-evaluation studies for the structure. This case study would be useful as a reference for engineers engaged in condition assessment and re-evaluation exercises of existing concrete structures.",9,article,False,https://doi.org/10.18702/acf.2019.06.30.25,https://openalex.org/W3044323474,Tasks: strength
Special Issue: Real World Application of SHM in Australia,Andy Nguyễn; Tommy H.T. Chan; Xinqun Zhu,2019,10.1177/1475921718823980,Structural Health Monitoring,"Australian Network of Structural Health Monitoring (ANSHM) was established in 2009 to promote and advance the field of SHM in Australia and the association has grown considerably since then. By November of 2018, ANSHM has the membership made of 45 organisations including 20 universities, 16 private companies, 6 road authorities and 3 research institutions. Every year ANSHM organises an annual workshop and/or conference sessions for members to exchange their research and practical developments in SHM. One edited book and nine journal special issues have been produced since the establishment of ANSHM. One of these special issues was organised in Structural Health Monitoring - an International Journal (SHMIJ) in 2014.

On 6–7 December 2017, ANSHM held its 9th annual workshop as part of the prestigious 8th International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructures (SHMII-8) in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The main focus of both SHMII-8 and the 9th ANSHM workshop was SHM in real-world application. Interestingly, all sessions of SHMII-8 and ANSHM workshop were held within the P block building at Gardens Point Campus of Queensland University of Technology (QUT) that was instrumented with Australia's first ever long-term full-scale SHM system. Inspired by this theme and high-quality presentations at the workshop, a special issue named 'Real World Application of SHM in Australia' was established in SHMIJ and the 9th ANSHM workshop speakers were invited to submit enhanced and extended versions of their papers to this Special Issue. After rigorous pre-screening, peer review and revision processes, fourteen papers were accepted for inclusion in the Special Issue. The contributions include deterioration assessment of the instrumented P block building at QUT using hybrid model updating and long-term vibration monitoring data, reliability-based load-carrying capacity assessment of bridges using SHM and non-linear analysis, and innovative vibration based damage identification methods with applications to cable-stayed, steel-truss or timber bridges as well as to frame, utility-pole or building structures. The Special Issue also includes new research on non-destructive evaluation of (i) incipient pitting corrosion in reinforced concrete structures, (ii) gaps between carbon fibre reinforced polymer composite and concrete surfaces, (iii) fatigue cracks in pipes, (iv) bolted joints, and (v) in-situ stress. Most studies were verified on real civil structures or large-scale laboratory models well reflecting the high applicability of the developed methods to solve real-world problems.

The influence of steel reinforcement on ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements in concrete of different strength ranges,Narmane Fodil; Mohamed Chemrouk; Amina Ammar,2019,10.1088/1757-899x/603/2/022049,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,"Abstract The present paper reports on the assessment of concrete strength, using non-destructive testing devices. The study focuses on Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) as a non-destructive tool for estimating the compressive strength of the concrete in real structures, using a UPV-strength correlation model. The objective is to highlight the steel reinforcement influence on the ultrasound pulse velocity (UPV) measurement as a mean of a non-destructive strength assessment of the concrete. UPV-strength correlation models are built on the basis of laboratory plain concrete specimens tested to destruction. However, the real life structures contain steel reinforcement which interferes with UPV measurements, resulting in the distortion of these measurements, particularly when the reinforcement bars lie in the wave propagation path. Thus, when assessing the quality of the concrete in real structures, it is recommended to avoid reinforcement rebars, which is often difficult, if not impossible to ensure, especially for highly reinforced structural elements. This work proposes an alternative which consists of assessing the influence of steel reinforcement on UPV measurements through a correction factor for UPV readings that will allow the user to take account of the presence of steel reinforcement when assessing the concrete strength of real structures through an ultra-sound pulse velocity testing. In the study, concretes in three different strength ranges were targeted; the aim being to assess the role of the concrete density and the manner with which it interacts with reinforcement rebars when measuring UPV in reinforced concrete structures. The strength ranges considered vary from ordinary, to moderate, to the high strength concrete. Cylindrical moulds made of concrete from three different strength ranges were cast; some of these moulds were reinforced with different longitudinal steel ratios (low, moderate, high) to simulate real practical cases. These concrete moulds were then subjected to UPV tests in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the rebars disposition in order to study the reinforcement influence on UPV from the two directions. A correction factor was then developed to work out of the real ultrasonic pulse velocity of concrete that can be used in the UPV-strength correlation model to determine the compressive strength. For the three concrete strength ranges considered in this study, the presence of steel reinforcement was found to affect the UPV measurements. The results show also that the effect of steel rebar on UPV measurements is more accentuated with a low concrete density, particularly in the presence of a high steel ratio and rebar lying in the parallel direction to the wave propagation path. Indeed, for high performances concrete, which is a higher density concrete, a high steel ratio was found to slightly modify the pulse velocity; moderate and low steel ratios did not affect the pulse velocity. For moderate and normal strength concretes, however, high and moderate steel ratios had noticeable effects on the UPV measurements, especially in the parallel direction; showing that UPV testing is not only affected by the presence of steel reinforcement in concrete, but it is also related to the steel ratio, the rebar disposition, and the concrete density. A correction factor is then necessary for UPV measurements to correlate the strengths of reinforced concrete structures.",7,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/603/2/022049,https://openalex.org/W2973322252,Tasks: strength

One effective method for preventing corrosion of steel reinforcement is the application of galvanic coatings to the reinforcement itself. The present study evaluated the performance of three groups of reinforcing steel bars (black steel, used as a reference and rebars electroplated with Zinc and Zinc-Nickel alloys) to corrosion and adherence to the concrete matrix. For the analysis of corrosion, the specimens were subjected to two different accelerated corrosion tests: salt spray exposure and wet and dry semi-cycles. The corrosion potential was measured for the qualitative monitoring of the corrosion process and the corrosion rate was estimated. In order to evaluate the steel-concrete adherence, the pullout test was used, in accordance with RILEM-CEB-FIP. The results showed that Zinc and Zinc-Nickel coatings increased the durability of the reinforcing bars and the accelerated corrosion test of wetting and drying cycles proved to be more aggressive compared to the salt spray method to evaluate the corrosion process in the reinforced concrete specimens.

A Prototype of an Electromagnetic Induction Sensor for Non-Destructive Estimation of the Presence of Corrosive Chemicals Ensuing Concrete Corrosion,K. A. Mamun; Ravin Deo; F. R. Islam; H. R. Pota; Aneesh A. Chand,2019,10.3390/s19091959,Sensors,"The corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete often leads to huge unbudgeted expenses for maintaining, monitoring and renovating an infrastructure. This is mainly due to the presence of salts or chemical chlorides that pose a danger to the concrete structures. The determination of the existence of these corrosive salts is vital for defining the service life of concrete. This research looked at developing an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor for the detection of corrosive salts. The first design adopted a single-loop coil (SLC) concept, and the second was based on a multiple-loop coil (MLC) one using copper wire. Tests were conducted on these two techniques, and with the results obtained, the latter seemed more promising; thus, a prototype sensor was developed using the MLC concept. As this new prototype sensor was able to detect the manifestation of chemical contents in a concrete structure, it could be used as a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for the detection of corrosive chemicals in concrete and has the further possibility of detecting corrosion in concrete.",7,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19091959,https://openalex.org/W2941566450,Tasks: deterioration

The RC (reinforced concrete) specimens which pasted strain gauges on the inner milling slots of steel bars were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. The test results indicate that an increase in the freeze-thaw cycles results in a linear decrease in the ultimate bond strength and shifts the section corresponding to the maximum bond stress towards the unloaded-end more and more severely. The relative slip value and bond stress between the smooth bars and concrete were evaluated through numerical simulation and test results. After the curve of bond stress and the position coordinate along steel bars of the RC (reinforced concrete) specimens were fitted, which is expressed by position function, the bond stress-slip constitutive relationship between concrete and smooth bars was consequently established under frost-salt conditions.

Due to lack of a permanent storage facility in the United States, an extension of the service life of dry casks that are currently in use and that were designed for shorter service lives is a critical step. Deterioration of concrete due to ASR is a major concern as has been reported for some nuclear facilities. In this study, the effect of ASR aging on the tip-over response of a vertical RC cask is experimentally studied for the first time using 1/3-scale physical models. An accelerated aging method was used to represent the long-term degradation of the structure. A series of non-destructive tests were performed to monitor the aging progress. At the end of the aging period, the structural performance of the casks is evaluated experimentally under tip-over impact.

Therefore improvement of the reliability of the used techniques and finding better correlations between the test results and the mechanical properties of masonry has proven to be of great importance. While several diagnostic procedures are commonly used in practice to test mechanical properties of masonry, e.g. Schmidt hammer test, analysis of drilled samples, penetration tests, etc. the results of these methods are considered reliable under laboratory conditions, several additional factors have to be taken into account in case of an in-situ application of these methods, that may largely affect the obtained results and conclusions.

Strength Assessment of Jute Fiber Reinforced Concrete by Destructive and Non-destructive Test Methods,Sara Yesmin; Ariful Islam,2019,,,"The search of a durable and low cost fiber reinforced cement concrete for construction works is an empirical challenge in developing countries. Economic scarcity have confined the use of carbon fibers in cementitious composites on a commercial level. Jute fiber has the potential to be used in reinforcement to surpass the inherent deficiencies in cementitious materials. In this research, jute fiber reinforced concrete is used to find out which test method is more reliable among destructive and non-destructive test methods. In recent years, one of the most challenging scientific method is intelligent defect detection. Non Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques are the most useful and the easiest methods due to their efficiency and low cost. The experimental process using Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity and Schmidt Rebound Hammer as Non-destructive Tests (NDT) are used in this paper to set up a correlation between the compressive strengths of compression tests and NDT values. These two tests have been used to find out the concrete quality by applying regression analysis models between compressive strength of jute fiber reinforced concrete and tests values. The relationship between compression strength of concrete collected from destructive test method and estimated results from NDT’s records using regression analysis are compared together to assess their reliability of prediction of concrete strength. The test results show that destructive test methods are the most reliable way to find out the original strength of test specimens. After destructive test methods, the rebound number method is more efficient in predicting the strength of concrete under certain conditions. Schmidt Hammer rebound tests is recommended to estimate the strength of concrete to reduce the number of cores taken from the structures in practical cases.",4,article,False,https://openalex.org/W2988760738,https://openalex.org/W2988760738,"Tasks: strength, defects"

AE Characterization of Brick Masonry Walls Mechanical Behavior: The Case-Study of Alessandria and Boves Barracks,Nicola Viale; Federico Accornero; Giuseppe Lacidogna; Giulio Ventura,2019,10.4028/www.scientific.net/kem.817.563,Key engineering materials,"IIn the present study, Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring technique is applied in order to characterize the brick masonry of two important military buildings located in Northern Italy: the barracks of Alessandria and Boves. The internal brick masonry walls of the two barracks object of the study are tested by two double flat-jack systems, in order to analyze the compressive strength of the structural material. Flat-jack testing is a versatile and powerful technique that provides significant information on the mechanical properties of historical constructions. The first applications of this technique on some historical monuments clearly showed its great potential. The flat-jack test method is only slightly destructive, and when double jacks are used, this test works according to the same principle as a standard compressive test. The difference is that it is performed in situ and the load is applied by means of two flat-jacks instead of the loading platens. During the tests, the stress-strain relationship of the masonry is determined by gradually increasing the pressure applied by the flat-jacks in the course of three loading-unloading cycles. Moreover, AE technique is coupled to the flat-jack testing, in order to assess the extent of damage in the masonry texture. Thus, AE technique makes it possible to highlight critical phenomena and fracture mechanics scale effects in the masonry by identifying the critical conditions, not entrusted to an analysis of the loading process (compression or shear), rather depending primarily on the distribution and evolution of crack patterns.",1,article,False,https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/kem.817.563,https://openalex.org/W2968389060,Tasks: strength

Ingemi,2019,10.1063/1.5099838,AIP conference proceedings,"Subsurface moisture content in Portland cement concrete structures indicates the short-term (cement hydration) and long-term (durability) of these structures and can be used in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM) of concrete structures. Subsurface moisture content of concrete structures provides insightful health-related information such as the potential of steel rebar corrosion and alkali-silica reaction (ASR) inside concrete. However, existing approaches for moisture measurement are either intrusive (e.g., embedded moisture sensors) or not applicable in the field (e.g., gamma-ray attenuation, neutron scattering). This paper presents a field-applicable, NDE technique for characterizing subsurface moisture content of concrete specimens, based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. Laboratory concrete specimens made of three water-to-cement (w/c) ratios (0.4, 0.5, and 0.55) were cast and conditioned to create various moisture contents in the range of 0% (oven-dried) to 4% (saturated). Concrete specimens were inspected by a 10GHz SAR imaging sensor to generate radar images for predicting both the w/c ratio and moisture content of each specimen. From our experimental data, it is found that the amplitude of SAR images can be used to predict the moisture content of concrete specimens. It is also found that critical contour area (distribution of SAR amplitudes) of SAR images increases with the increase of moisture content, serving as a useful indicator for subsurface moisture distribution inside concrete. An empirical model capable of predicting both the w/c ratio and moisture content from an SAR image is proposed.

FUNDAMENTAL STUDY ON DETECTING INTERNAL DEFECT OF TIMBER DUE TO TERMITE AND ITS MECHANICAL IMPROVEMENT WITH RESIN,Akiko Ohtsuka; Kei‐ichi Imamoto; Chizuru Kiyohara,2019,10.3130/aijs.84.321,Journal of Structural and Construction Engineering (Transactions of AIJ),"In Japan, wood has been used for many years as a building material. On the other hand, wet condition is the strongest factor to promote degradation of wood, and it may cause corrosion and damage to termite and so on. These biological decompositions proceed more rapidly than ultraviolet deterioration and there exists a significant fatal deterioration due to remarkable strength drop. Especially for valuable timber buildings that have existed since long ago, it is essential to achieve a permanent maintenance of the building by diagnosing the decrease of strength due to deterioration. However, except for important cultural assets, assessment of the durability of Japanese cultural heritage buildings is often entrusted to local public entities, and evaluation criteria detected by visual investigation is sometimes not accurate. In addition, when deterioration progresses only in the inside of wood, it is difficult to judge deterioration visually from outside, and, at present, a sufficient diagnostic method has not been studied. Furthermore, it is common that the restoration and refurbishment method currently implemented for the biodegradation of wooden buildings is to remove degraded parts and partially replace with new healthy wood. It is desirable to reinforce the original part as it is to restore the strength, but it has not been put into practical use yet. In this study, a basic experiment was carried out with the aim of proposing a member that was internally deteriorated due to termite's damage. Quantitative evaluation of this damage degree was proposed and the effect of reinforcing the inside part with resin and its non-destructive evaluation were verified. The findings obtained in this study are shown below. Detection of the internal deterioration of the artificial drilled degradation by the ultrasonic method was able to perform at about 30% of the defect by volume. Although it was difficult to detect the defect of about 10% by volume by the ultra-sonic method, the compressive strength is not markedly decreased. On the other hands, the clear reduction of the strength was observed at the rate of 30% defect the and the ultrasonic method successfully detected the pulse change. In addition, the strength improvement by filling resin was performed and the ultrasonic method successfully evaluated the defect. The relationship between the propagation velocity ratio by the ultrasonic method and the mass ratio was high. Similar results were obtained in the case of the deterioration by termites. Hence, the internal deterioration can be detected by the ultrasonic method. Meanwhile, improvement of the strength by resin filling was also increased the velocity of pulse of the ultrasonic. This might indicate that the strength improvement effect by the resin filling could be evaluated by ultrasonic method. Similar to the compression test with the reinforcement by resin filling, bending Young's modulus and bending load were partially improved and the effect could be evaluated by the ultrasonic surface method. In the future, as a practical research, authors will examine current improvement effect of bending strength, construction method such as resin selection and resin injection method. In addition, quantitative evaluation of resin filling degree and reinforcing effect by the ultrasonic wave propagation speed are considered to be necessary.",0,article,True,https://doi.org/10.3130/aijs.84.321,https://openalex.org/W2927425861,Tasks: strength
Evaluation of Concrete Quality for Reinforced Concrete Frame Members Exposed to Natural Fires at Early Ages Using in situ Test Methods,Muhammad Omer; Dilshad Kakasor Ismael Jaf,2019,10.2174/1874149501913010201,The Open Civil Engineering Journal,"Background: In recent years, numerous reinforced concrete buildings have been constructed in Iraq and some developing countries. Fire accidents occur in wooden formwork especially during the summer season due to problems associated with the construction procedure and on-site management. And fires can erupt during the construction stage of buildings. Introduction: Generally, if fire accidents occur in a wooden formwork, in these situations the concrete in the field is at an early age ( i.e ., “young”). The internal structure and chemical composition of early-age concrete are different from that of the carrier due to incomplete hydration at an early age. This study aimed to evaluate the strength of reinforced concrete frames at early ages when exposed to natural fire. The evaluation of existing buildings is an important issue that involves researchers and engineers in many countries. Methods: The experimental program consisted of constructing three full-scale reinforced concrete frames that are then exposed to natural fire. When the concrete age reaches three and five days by firing its formwork, the concrete quality of the structure was evaluated via ultrasonic pulse velocity as a nondestructive measurement. Core test was used as a destructive technique to implement a relationship between compressive strength and nondestructive measurements Results: The results showed that the frame exposed to natural fire early was generally more affected than the other frame, and its compressive strength was reduced close to 33%. The results also showed that the ultrasonic pulse velocity test for the structural elements was smaller than those of the core test Conclusion: It can be concluded that the current assessment methodology must be evaluated to provide practical suggestions that can enhance the reliability of assessing the in situ strength of existing concrete structures by nondestructive tests and cores.",0,article,True,https://doi.org/10.2174/1874149501913010201,https://openalex.org/W3000384406,Tasks: strength

INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY FOR DETECTING DEFECTS IN CONCRETE STRUCTURES,Gene F. Sirca; Hojjat Adeli,2018,10.3846/jcem.2018.6186,Journal of Civil Engineering and Management,"The traditional methods for inspecting large concrete structures such as dams and cooling towers require erecting large amounts of scaffolding to access the surface of the concrete structure in order to sound the concrete with an impact device or hammer to expose the damaged or defective areas. Another method for accessing the surface of a large concrete structure is to employ climbing inspections which poses a considerable safety risk. These traditional methods are used to determine defect or damage within a few inches of the surface. In addition to the logistic difficulty of these methods a hammer can cause damage if care is not taken. Further, it can cover only a small area. Infrared Thermography (IRT), also referred to as thermal imaging, utilizes the infrared spectrum to show differences in heat dissipating from a structure using a thermal imaging camera. This paper presents a review of the IRT research for detecting defects in concrete structures. Health monitoring and damage detection of large structures such as bridges and high-rise buildings has been a very active area of research in recent years.

Sensitive Damage Detection of Reinforced Concrete Bridge Slab by “Time-Variant Deconvolution” of SHF-Band Radar Signal,Takahiro Yamaguchi; Tsukasa Mizutani; Minoru Tarumi; Di Su,2018,10.1109/tgrs.2018.2866991,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"In this paper, we focus on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for infrastructural health monitoring, especially for the monitoring of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge slab. Due to the demand of noncontact and high-speed monitoring technique which can handle vast amounts of aging infrastructures, GPR is a promising tool. However, because radar images consist of many reflected waves, they are usually difficult to interpret. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of system is not enough considering the thickness of target damages, cracks, and segregation are millimeter-to-centimeter order while the wavelength of ordinary GPR ultrahigh-frequency band is over 10 cm. To address these problems, for the purpose of sensitive damage detection, we propose a new algorithm based on deconvolution utilizing a super high-frequency (SHF) band system. First, a distribution of reflection coefficient is inversely estimated by 1-D bridge slab model. Because concrete is found to be a lossy medium at SHF band, we consider the attenuation of signal in deconvolution. The algorithm is called ""time-variant deconvolution"" in this paper. After the validation by simulation, the effects of the algorithm and frequency band on damage detection accuracy are evaluated by a field experiment. Though the results show a 1-mm horizontal crack is not detected by measured waves, when it is filled with water, it is detected by time-variant deconvolution. Moreover, the 1-mm dried crack is detected only by time-variant deconvolution at SHF band, which greatly emphasizes the peaks of the reflection coefficient of the crack.",39,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1109/tgrs.2018.2866991,https://openalex.org/W2891460087,Tasks: defects

It is desired to assess the performance of the foam concrete structure on site instead of testing isolated specimen in laboratory condition, as the changes in site environment and different construction procedure will affect the testing result. For on-site testing of foam concrete, non-destructive methods are required to avoid damage to structures. Ultrasonic pulse velocity method (UPV) is one of the attractive methods used for onsite testing of concretes due to its benefits such as accurate results, high sampling rate and cost-effectiveness. UPV method can determine various concrete properties such as strength, dynamic elastic constants, defects, uniformity and effects of curing time. However, for foam concrete application, the effect of high porosity on the UPV test results is largely unknown in current literature. Existing research explored the relationship between porosity and strength for metals, as well as the relationship between UPV and porosity for normal mortars. Yet no correlation between UPV and porosity for lightweight foam concrete is developed, which is very critical in the strength estimation and site quality control of the construction.

However, the results only show qualitative meaning as corrosion risk rather than the corrosion itself, such as the size and location of corrosion. In this study, boundary element inverse analysis was proposed to be performed to detect rebar corrosion of the 2004 tsunami-affected structure in Aceh, using several electrical potential measurement data on the concrete surface. One RC structure in Peukan Bada, an area heavily damaged by the tsunami, was selected for the study. In 2004 the structure was submerged more than 5 m by the tsunami. Boundary element inverse analysis was developed by combining the boundary element method (BEM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The corrosion was detected by evaluating measured and calculated electrical potential data. The measured and calculated electrical potential on the concrete surface was obtained by using a half-cell potential meter and by performing BEM, respectively. The solution candidates were evaluated by employing PSO. Simulation results show that boundary element inverse analysis successfully detected the size and location of corrosion for the case study. Compared with the actual corrosion, the error of simulation result was less than 5%. Hence, it shows that boundary element inverse analysis is very promising for further development to detect rebar corrosion.

Some old masonry and concrete bricks of the walls had been substituted by new concrete bricks made of polymer-modified mortar with Moringa oleifera and Gracilaria Sp. and then covered by premixed mortar additive. Those masonry walls were built in Sriwulan village, Sayung and Pucang Gading— as the control site. Non destructive Rebound Hammer Test was applied on the masonry walls aged 12, 13, and 14 months. Each masonry wall was tested by 5 (five) zones (A, B, C, D, and E). Ten shoots were applied on each zone. The findings revealed: 1) In dry area, Pucang Gading site, there is a consistent performance of compressive strength masonry wall aged 12, 13, and 14 months, 2) In tidal flooding-prone area, Sayung site, there is fluctuative performance of compressive strength masonry wall aged 12, 13, and 14 months, 3) Compressive strength of masonry walls aged 14 months in Pucang Gading site is generally fluctuative, particularly at zone A to E (39.4 MPa to 44 MPa), while in Sayung site, compressive strength of zone A to E indicates declining values (44.3 MPa to 40.8 MPa), 4) At age 14 months, the compressive strength of zone B and E in Sayung site is lower than that in Pucang Gading site, due to tidal flooding, and 5) Slight distinction of compressive strength in Pucang Gading and Sayung site may be provided by premixed mortar additive that covers the walls.",11,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5042982,https://openalex.org/W2810428251,Tasks: strength
Influence of steam curing on compressive fatigue performance of high-volume slag concrete,Xiancui Yan; Linhua Jiang; Ning Xu; Zijian Song; Yunjie Chen,2018,10.1680/jmacr.18.00014,Magazine of Concrete Research,"Compressive fatigue generally causes permanent internal damage to concrete structures. This paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the influences of steam curing and slag replacement on the compressive fatigue performance of concrete. After 10 000 cycles loading at stresses of 0·5, 0·6 and 0·7, the residual compressive strength of concrete was measured to investigate the mechanical property after fatigue. The fatigue damage was determined using two non-destructive techniques: the ultrasonic pulse velocity and electrochemical impedance methods. In the electrochemical impedance method, the R 1 and n parameters fitted from the R e (CR 1 (QR 2 )) circuit model were used to characterise the pore structure. The results showed that the residual compressive strength of standard-cured concrete without slag replacement decreased with increasing stress. The compressive fatigue damage of specimens after steam curing was greater than that after standard curing. In steam curing conditions, the fatigue damage of concrete increased with increasing slag replacement. The results indicated that electrochemical impedance is an appropriate method to evaluate compressive fatigue damage.",11,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1680/jmacr.18.00014,https://openalex.org/W2800043869,"Tasks: strength, defects"
Estimating In Situ Compressive Strength of Existing Concrete Structures,Yue Choong Kog,2018,10.1061/(asce)sc.1943-5576.0000374,Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction,An upper-bound and lower-bound approach using a combination of the rebound hammer test or Windsor probe test and ultrasonic pulse velocity test or core test for estimating in situ compressive strength of existing concrete structures is presented. A bias factor for each of the nondestructive tests and core test was introduced to account for the overestimation of characteristic in situ compressive strength by rebound hammer test and Windsor probe test and underestimation of characteristic in situ compressive strength by ultrasonic pulse velocity test and core test. In situ concrete testing results of 34 existing concrete structures aged 4–73 years were analyzed to obtain a range of each of the bias factors.

In this paper, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging for characterizing subsurface moisture content and distribution is proposed, using a concrete panel specimen as an example. A 0.3×0.3×0.05-m concrete panel specimen cast and conditioned in laboratory was air-dried for almost 5 months and simultaneously monitored for its moisture variation by SAR imaging. From the analysis of its SAR images at different moisture contents, it was found that SAR images can not only qualitatively capture the moisture distribution inside concrete but can also quantitatively correlate with the overall moisture content inside concrete. Higher SAR amplitudes indicate stronger electromagnetic scattering response, suggesting greater values of dielectric constant. A critical contour in SAR images is proposed as an insightful measure for the subsurface sensing of concrete. An approach for determining the critical contour in each SAR image is proposed.",8,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)as.1943-5525.0000945,https://openalex.org/W2890977333,Tasks: moisture
Prediction of concrete strength by non-destructive testing in old structures: Effect of core number on the reliability of prediction,Boussahoua Youcef; Saïd Kenai; Khoudja Ali‐Benyahia,2018,10.1051/matecconf/201814902007,MATEC Web of Conferences,"When assessing the quality of concrete on site, it is necessary to base the interpretation on reliable and representative test results. Generally, core tests are the most reliable and effective method for assessing the quality of concrete. Unfortunately, this type of testing is expensive and time consuming and only a limited number of cores can be carried out in practice. Non-destructive tests (NDT) can be used to overcome these drawbacks. The most popular and widely used NDT methods for assessing concrete strength are rebound hammer (RH) and the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). The use of these methods provide unreliable predictions unless their results are correlated to destructive tests. A sufficient number of cores is needed to accurately predict the compressive strength of concrete. Recent researches have been carried out for identifying and optimizing the number of cores able to stabilize the calibration model on data from recent structures and from synthetic data. However, more case studies are needed to draw conclusions. In addition, the effect of the degradation of reinforced concrete elements on the number of cores needed for obtaining a reliable prediction needs to be investigated. In this paper, RH and UPV in conjunction with core tests are used to evaluate the concrete compressive strength in existing structures built in the 1970s and degraded mainly by steel corrosion. More than 234 elements were tested by RH and 86 elements by UPV. Also, 36 cores were drilled and tested under compression. A regression analysis is adopted to establish the correlations between NDT and strength measurements. The accuracy of the predictive assessment was evaluated using two indicators: the root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (r 2 ).

After validating the GPR results through the experiments, the GPR system was used for nondestructive assessment of the pedestrian bridge deck. From the scanned results, the location and orientation of the reinforcing bar were established.

Use of Ground Penetrating Radar measurement combined to resistivity measurement for characterization of the concrete moisture,Małgorzata Wutke,2018,10.1109/icgpr.2018.8441577,2018 17th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR),"Durability of concrete structures is mainly affected by the corrosion, because corrosion causes extensive damages inside the structure and loss of structural integrity of the material. Basically, the cause of corrosion appearance is contact the reinforcement with water and chlorides, therefore the durability of concrete varies the facility of penetrating of water and chemical agents into concrete. To service the existing concrete structures in order to embalm their durability means to measure water penetrability and water content thereto. In this context the non-destructive techniques of testing structures play promising role, especially the techniques based on electromagnetic waves. Mainly the radar waves emitted by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) are very sensitive to water content of the medium through which they propagate. The paper presents great potential of the radar measurement combined with resistivity measurement for the characterization of potential concrete corrosion in an early stage. Two laboratory experiments were performed. First one was performed in order to study the GPR capacity to assess the changing of water content in the concrete samples. Two samples were prepared, one with reinforcement and one without. At the beginning of the test the samples were completely saturated. Then measurement were carried out during 2 months in order to observe the relationship between saturation degree of the concrete and the direct waves amplitude, the propagation velocity of the radar waves, as well as the dielectric permittivity and the resistivity of concrete. It was observed a great agreement between the parameters of the radar waves and concrete moisture. Next experiment were conducted to study the capacity of GPR to assess the water penetrability in hardened concrete. For this purpose concrete specimen was dried in an oven. The specimen had inside the sensors which had been measured the water content. Right after drying the sample had been put into the water and then GPR measurement were acquired.

Empirical Formula for Assessment Concrete Compressive Strength by Using Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity,Hameed Shakir Al-Aasm,2018,10.14419/ijet.v7i4.20.25860,International Journal of Engineering & Technology,"Statistical practical program was carried out to establish a fairly accurate empirical formula between compressive strength of concrete and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The work has a strong empirical base, but it is firmly governed by theory. In concrete, the compressive strength of concrete is related to the type, proportion and physical properties of aggregate but it is well known to be intensely affected by the properties of the cement paste, which relate, mainly, to the w/c ratio. The other variables such as age and density of concrete, salt content in fine aggregate and curing method have a relatively little effect on compressive strength of concrete. Therefore, the program involves field testing of reinforced concrete members that their w/c ratio and cube uniaxial compressive strength are known. The results were used as input data in statistical program (SPSS) to develop an empirical formula between the compressive strength of concrete and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The proposed formula was confirmed by the results of previous experiments.

Estimating moisture changes in concrete using GPR velocity analysis: potential and limitations,Philipp Koyan; Jens Tronicke; Niklas Allroggen; Andreas Kathage; Michael Willmes,2018,10.1109/icgpr.2018.8441572,2018 17th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR),"Chloride-induced corrosion of steel is a key problem for reinforced concrete buildings such as bridges. Here, the moisture conditions are of major interest because they are closely related to chloridization and its tempo-spatial variability. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is commonly used for extensive non-destructive imaging of small-scale structural defects in concrete. To identify the potential and the limitations of GPR for practical investigation of reinforced concrete buildings, a longterm GPR monitoring experiment on a well-defined reinforced concrete specimen characterized by a typical rebar geometry has been performed under laboratory-like conditions. The GPR data analyzed in this study have been acquired before and after a three-week immersion of the specimen in water using a geometric setup and antenna system as commonly applied in concrete inspection. Before analyzing the data in detail, we apply a typical imaging processing flow and demonstrate the potential of our GPR data to image the spatial location of the rebar structures. To assess the moisture content of the specimen and its tempo-spatial variability, our study focuses on developing and performing an automatic migration-based velocity analysis, which also allows to estimate uncertainties in the derived velocities. Although analyzing single diffraction hyperbolas is not sufficient to resolve moisture changes in the range of a few percent, we are able to identify a mean temporal trend of increasing moisture content related to the immersion in water at two depth levels of the specimen. The observed trends and the estimated change of concrete moisture content are in good agreement with independent reference measurements.

On the use of ground penetrating radar to detect rebar corrosion in concrete structures,David J. Eisenmann; F. J. Margetan; Shelby Ellis,2018,10.1063/1.5031532,AIP conference proceedings,"Two new studies are summarized in this paper. In the first, we compare recent GPR measurements on the same bridge to those obtained in 2012. The newer measurements use both the 1.6 GHz antenna used in the earlier work and an alternative higher frequency antenna (2.6 GHz). We discuss similarities and differences between the old and new results at 1.6 GHz, and also summarize the effect of the frequency change on the newer measurements. Many factors can contribute to the strength of the GPR echo seen from a given rebar, including the rebar's length, its distance from and tilt angle relative to the antenna, and the location and size of the metal-loss region. In the second section of the paper we discuss new laboratory measurements to systematically investigate these geometric effects. In 2016 we studied such effects using a simplified measurement setup where only an air layer separated the antenna from the rebar. Here we discuss similar measurements simulating rebar embedded in concrete. For our concrete ""phantom"" we use a layer of moist sand in between two parallel concrete blocks. When the moisture content is properly chosen, the EM properties of sand are similar to those of cured concrete. The block/sand/block sandwich then serves as a concrete-like medium in which a rebar can be inserted and readily repositioned.

Non-Destructive testing of concrete with ground penetrating radar,Elias Hammarström,2018,,"Publications (Konstfack University of Arts, Crafts, and Design)","Concrete structures are susceptible to deterioration over time and it is vital to continually assess concrete structures to maintain the structural integrity and prolong the service life. In recent years there has been an increased interest in non-destructive testing of concrete, i.e. assessing the state of the concrete without causing any damage to the structure in the process. There are many different techniques that falls under the term non-destructive testing and one of these that have gained prominence during the last few years is Georadar or ground penetrating radar, often shortened as GPR. GPR is a technique where microwaves are sent into the surface of the concrete by a device, the waves will reflect back to the device when encountering interfaces of areas with different electric properties. The waves are then received by the same device indicating the internal structure of the concrete. This makes the technique an excellent way to find reinforcement bars as the electric properties of concrete and metal strongly differ. In theory though, the technique should also be able to detect other internal differences in concrete, such as voids and corrosion areas but further research is still needed in these areas. This aim of this report is to evaluate ground penetrating radar as a non-destructive technique for assessment of concrete structures. In order to do this different tests has been conducted to evaluate the general performance and usability with a literature review introducing the science behind and what conclusions other researches has reached and using a testing methodology to reach the results. The tests can in a simple way be divided into two parts, first lab tests on a slab in a controlled setting where the internal structure was known, and then two shorter field trips in order to evaluate the performance properly insitu. The results were, to some extent, ambiguous. Although it was found that GPR is an excellent method for finding and locating near-surface reinforcement it was also concluded that the results could vary significantly depending on the location. In one of the field trips the performance of the GPR technique was compared to the performance of traditional cover meter and in this case the portability of the cover meter outperformed the somewhat clunky handling of the GPR. The concrete cover measurement using post-processing of the radar data gave a rough estimate, but once again evaluation still relied on the insitu conditions and the estimate were sometimes questionable. Finding reinforcement below the first layer yielded differing results and it was concluded that further tests were needed to fully evaluate the capabilities of the technique in this regard. The conclusions of the thesis was that although the tests show some potential for the method the results expected from GPR would strongly depend on suitability of the project and experience of the user. One important limiting factor was the availability of devices. For the current project only one specific device was used, it was theorized that another GPR device could get better results depending on the purpose. Furthermore, the lack of experience was also considered to be a limiting factor that might have had an effect on the results. For future research more tests on lower reinforcement and tests on detection of deterioration were suggested. Comparative studies with other similar non-destructive techniques were also considered to be an area of possible interest.",3,article,True,https://openalex.org/W2994967281,https://openalex.org/W2994967281,"Tasks: geometry, deterioration"
GPR-Based Deterioration Mapping in Subway Networks,Thikra Dawood; Zhenhua Zhu; Tarek Zayed,2018,10.1061/9780784481295.036,Construction Research Congress 2018,"Water leakage through soil has been considered the most serious problem and the main cause of concrete degradation in subway facilities. Several deterioration mechanisms are derived from water intrusion, among others are concrete cracking, spalling, and water voids. These mechanisms can compromise the structural integrity and jeopardize public safety. The detection and evaluation of concrete structures are predominantly conducted on the basis of visual inspection (VI) techniques, which are known to be time-consuming, subjective, and qualitative in nature. Although, these technologies may be consistent in finding surface defects, e.g., cracks, and spalling, they fall short in detecting subsurface distresses such as air voids, and water voids. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been widely used for the inspection and evaluation of concrete infrastructure. Nevertheless, few research endeavors were conducted for the detection and mapping of air/water voids. This paper presents a GPR-based assessment model for subway networks. The model performs damage identification and localization of air voids and water voids in the concrete subsurface. It provides a systematic approach for the detection and mapping through the incorporation of image-based analysis (IBA) and processing techniques. First, a defect detection scheme is designed to establish a consistent inspection pattern. Second, subsurface data are collected in a subway network facility. Third, the position and dimension of the detected distresses are mapped to estimate the severity of deterioration. The proposed method was implemented on assessing a segment in Montréal subway network. Validation of the results was conducted through visual inspection, digital images, thermal images and concrete coring samples which demonstrated high correlation and compatibility with the constructed GPR-based maps.

Nondestructive Evaluation Of Corrosion Damage In Reinforced Concrete Aged Slab Specimen,Rawya Abdulsattar Abduljabbar,2018,,Scholar Commons (University of South Carolina),"The deterioration of concrete bridge decks presents a maintenance challenge for most transportation agencies and bridge owners. This problem increases during the freeze-thaw cycle. De-icing salts can accelerate the deterioration process. Corrosion of steel reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures is considered a dominant factor causing premature deterioration, especially those structures located in a coastal environment. The resulting corrosion product produced has several times the volume of steel, resulting in cracking of the concrete cover if the corrosion is significant. In this study, a bridge deck specimen was subjected to an artificial environment to accelerate the corrosion process. Prior to this step, visual inspection, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Infrared Thermography (IR), Impact Icho (IE), and Half- Cell Potential (HCP) were performed on the bridge deck specimen by Bridge Diagnostics, Inc. (BDI) and Infrasense. The results of GPR, IR and IE indicated that the deck was in good condition while the HCP measurements indicated little to no active corrosion activity. During the accelerated corrosion process, corrosion activity and corrosion rate were estimated with half-cell potential and linear polarization resistance measurements. Impact-echo and ultra-sonic pulse velocity tests were conducted periodically to assess concrete damage. Corrosion losses required to initiate cracks were estimated.

A new methodology involving statistical analyses was therefore developed. After acoustic impact-echo data are collected and analyzed, the results are normalized by the median for each channel, a Gaussian distribution is fit to the histogram of the data, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence test or Otsu's method is then used to determine the optimum threshold for differentiating between intact and delaminated concrete.

Time frequency domain analysis on shotcrete bonding state using IE-SASW method,Mazlina Razali; Zainab Mohamed; Khairu Amin Ismail; Najwa Mohd Faudzi,2018,10.1063/1.5062698,AIP conference proceedings,"Impact Echo combine with Spectral Analysis of Surface wave (IE-SASW) method is a combination of two nondestructive testing method that has been widely used nowadays. This method is used to evaluate the integrity of concrete structure as well as for the construction quality control with a good accuracy without any structural damages. Impact Echo (IE) was used for detailed nondestructive evaluation whereas Spectral Analysis of Surface Wave (SASW) method was employed for the measurement of the representative P-wave velocity and for the evaluation of concrete quality. In this study, IE-SASW signals were applied to the shotcrete which has been considered the curing time for weathered soil in Malaysia. In experimental study using a slab model, effects of different bonding condition were examined to study the advantage in determining the variation of P-wave velocity for the whole thickness. The IE-SASW nondestructive test was applied to the shotcrete to investigate the bonding state with an advanced signal-processing technique known as Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT). The effect of the bonding state on IE-STFT signal characteristics was obtained through mathematical and experimental studies. This paper represents the analysis of time-frequency domain signals from laboratory studies through simulation of void,debonded and fully bonded conditions applied on the shotcrete. All conditions are considering the curing time and size of impact signals to compare the different thickness of void with the different bonding condition. The effect of bonding state in void condition is that the stress wave is reflected more from the interface between the shotcrete and soil layers due to the gradual increase in the impedance mismatch. Consequently, more entrapped air appear in a certain period in the shotcrete layer, implying that the main frequency components become higher and that the resonance duration becomes smaller. In conclusion, the combination of this technique provide more reliable data interpretation.",1,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5062698,https://openalex.org/W2895106206,Tasks: defects
Electromagnetic characterization of white spruce at different moisture contents using synthetic aperture radar imaging,Christopher M. Ingemi; Jones Owusu Twumasi; Tzuyang Yu,2018,10.1117/12.2296343,,"Detection and quantification of moisture content inside wood (timber) is key to ensuring safety and reliability of timber structures. Moisture inside wood attracts insects and fosters the development of fungi to attack the timber, causing significant damages and reducing the load bearing capacity during their design life. The use of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques (e.g., microwave/radar, ultrasonic, stress wave, and X-ray) for condition assessment of timber structures is a good choice. NDE techniques provide information about the level of deterioration and material properties of timber structures without obstructing their functionality. In this study, microwave/radar NDE technique was selected for the characterization of wood at different moisture contents. A 12 in-by-3.5 in-by-1.5 in. white spruce specimen (picea glauca) was imaged at different moisture contents using a 10 GHz synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor inside an anechoic chamber.

Nine cylinder specimens with a diameter of 150 mm and a height of 300 mm and 27 cube specimens of 200x200x200 mm were prepared. Nine reinforced concrete beam specimens of 100x150x1100 mm were also prepared to represent a component of the reinforced concrete structure. Hammer and UPV apparatuses were applied to the cylinder and cube specimens considered. Results concluded that the value of the pulse velocity is directly proportional to the load and inversely proportional to the residual strength. The concrete structure with a residual strength of more than 60% is considered healthy or a structural in “good” condition. The concrete structure is also healthy when the v measured gives a value of 3.5 and above.

Spatial Evaluation of the Corrosion Condition of Reinforced Concrete Structures,Sylvia Keßler,2018,10.5006/c2018-11133,,"Abstract Reinforced concrete structures form the backbone of our aging infrastructure. Most of these existing structures have experienced damage or deterioration. As part of ongoing condition assessment it is necessary to identify the extent, nature, cause and prognosis of deterioration using a range of tools and methods, including prediction models. Deterioration of reinforced concrete structures is often attributed to reinforcement corrosion initiated due to application of deicing salt during wintertime or chlorides from marine environment. Thus, corrosion detection, e.g. half-cell potential measurement, is of major importance for condition assessment. The information gained during corrosion detection can be used for updating the probabilistic service life prediction at time of inspection. Major impact on the accuracy of the updated service life prediction besides the probabilistic model itself is the reliability of the used inspection methods. Since first results on the reliability of half-cell potential measurements are published this data can be used to update corrosion probability taking into account not only the temporal aspect but also the spatial variability of reinforcement corrosion. This paper presents a case study for updating the corrosion probability with half-cell potential measurement data.",0,article,False,https://doi.org/10.5006/c2018-11133,https://openalex.org/W3023838689,Tasks: deterioration

Medeiros-Junior; Paulo Helène,2017,10.1590/s1983-41952017000400005,Revista IBRACON de Estruturas e Materiais,"ABSTRACT The method of measuring the corrosion potential is used as an electrochemical tool for helping the monitoring of the corrosion of reinforcements of concrete structures. As a criterion for evaluating results it is common to use intervals of corrosion potential and their correlation with corrosion probability, as precognizes ASTM C 876:2015. With this criterion, it is possible to establish an overview of the thermodynamic situation of corrosion in the structure or in the test specimen in laboratory. However, the method is influenced by several factors related with the concrete, the environment and with procedures adopted at the moment of executing the readings. Aiming to provide information to guide the technical and scientific environment regarding the right use of this type of non-destructive testing, the objective of this work is to evaluate some possible factors influencing the reading of corrosion potential, such as: moisture content of the concrete, water/cement ratio, thickness of the concrete cover and degree of contamination by chlorides. Results indicate that moisture and degree of contamination of the concrete by chloride ions had a tendency of making the corrosion potential more electronegative. Besides, it was verified that the influence of the cover is different for the case of contaminated concrete (1% of chlorides by mass of cement) and not contaminated with chlorides: the influence of the thickness of the cover, in the case of concrete contaminated by chlorides, was inversely proportional, in other words, the greater the cover thickness is, the less electronegative the value of the corrosion potential will be. On the other hand, in cases of concretes without chlorides, the effect of the cover thickness in the readings or corrosion potential was irrelevant. All this information was proved with 95% of statistical significance.",35,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1983-41952017000400005,https://openalex.org/W2741251155,"Tasks: geometry, moisture"

Also use of fiber in concrete may arrest the shrinkage cracks, decreasing the chloride permeability and increasing the durability of concrete. Durability of concrete with glass fiber and by replacement of cement and sand partially by supplementary cementitious material such as fly ash and pond ash, respectively is measured by conducting shrinkage test, bulk electrical resistivity, SEM and ultrasonic pulse velocity test.

Suppression of Clutters Caused by Periodic Scatterers in GPR Profiles With Multibandpass Filtering for NDT&amp;E Imaging Enhancement,Jianping Xiao; Lanbo Liu,2017,10.1109/jstars.2017.2752163,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,"Many civil infrastructures contain periodic elements for the purposes of foundation support or strength reinforcement. Good examples are the sleepers for rail track support and the rebars in reinforced concrete structures. For engineering nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) using ground penetrating radar (GPR) these periodic elements in the near subsurface act as scatterers that generate clutters in GPR profiles and mask the signature of the targets and hinder GPR's capability in defect detection and characterization. In this paper, we develop an algorithm using multibandpass filtering (MPF) technique to suppress the clutters in GPR profiles caused by periodic scatterers. We first extract the spatial information of the periodic scatterers and carry out spectral analysis to characterize the clutter energy in multiple wavenumbers. Then, we use this information to design the MPF in wavenumber domain and execute the filtering back in space domain with proper windowing. We test the effectiveness by applying the algorithm to a synthetic data set that simulates GPR survey on a railway system. The filtering results are very encouraging. We also apply MPF to the field GPR data collected on the Tibetan Railway. A fouled area in the ballast can be much clearly visualized than in the original, clutter-masked GPR profile. We also apply MPF in steel bar reinforced concrete slab and compare the results with the redatuming and migration methods. The MPF appears superior in clutter suppression caused by periodic scatters.

Steel reinforcement (bar) defects or deterioration may lead to crack propagation and strength decrease in RC structural members. Deterioration also changes the steel magnetic properties; the evaluation of these changes can be investigated by an indirect passive and non-invasive method to locate and quantify defect in RC structures.

The passive magnetic flux density of steel bar with three small holes in three different positions and locations along the bar is measured in the laboratory. A signal processing methodology based on frequency spectrum analysis and filtering is applied to the experimental data, and the results are compared with the numerical simulation. The processed data from the experimental test shows the potential of PMI method to detect, locate and evaluate bar condition.

The UPV test was conducted in each layer where reinforced steel bars were present and absent. It was found out that UPV test results was insignificant to all non-accelerated concrete, while it indicated significant damage for accelerated corrosion rate of more than 8 mm per year. In accelerated condition, the decrease in strength under UPV test was more than 20% for all specimens along the reinforced bars, and less than 15% for all specimens along the layer with no steel bars.

At the chair for concrete construction of the University of German Armed Forces a literature study on protective concrete components under gunfire and contact detonation was conducted. In a first short experimental study tests were performed in order to obtain data for numerical modeling and for supplementary test setups. In the main research project different mixtures of steel fiber concrete were produced and investigated under gunfire and contact detonation. For the concrete local raw material from the area of mission was used as aggregates and cement. Plates for the contact detonation with different thicknesses, varying fiber geometries and reinforcement systems were produced. The plates for contact detonation were loaded with 850 g PETN explosive at the test facility of the German Armed Forces Technical Center for Protective and Special Technologies. During the contact detonation a pressure wave runs through the plate and is reflected as a tensile wave at the free surface, opposite to the loaded surface. This tensile wave generates a damage crater on the rear side of the plate. The volume as well as the surface of the crater is determined by Impact-Echo tests, by 3D-scans and by measurements of the crater geometry. One target of this project is to work out a semi empirical formula for the determination of the crater volume and its surface in dependence on the main input parameters in order to provide a mobile application for the soldiers in charge of the infrastructure during a mission.

Assessment of Strength Degradation of Historic Masonry Monuments due to Damage: Load Path–Based Approach,Saurabh Prabhu; Sez Atamturktur,2017,10.1061/(asce)st.1943-541x.0001843,Journal of Structural Engineering,"Historic masonry monuments experience aging and accumulated damage, which consequently degrade both their stiffness and strength. Stiffness degradation can be quantified through nondestructive testing and has been widely used to determine the onset of structural damage by monitoring the changes in monuments’ dynamic behavior. For justifying and configuring repair and rehabilitation activities, strength degradation (i.e., loss in load-carrying capacity) provides a more relevant indicator than does stiffness degradation. However, strength degradation is also significantly less feasible to assess because it requires the use of destructive testing. In this paper, the authors estimate strength degradation by establishing an empirical relationship between loss in structural redundancy due to damage and the corresponding loss in load-carrying capacity. Here, structural redundancy is represented as the ability of the structure to accommodate the applied load through alternative load paths. Loss in structural redundancy is approximated as the disturbance in the load path due to the development and progression of cracks.

Unlike their modern counterparts, these structures are mostly made of adobe, clay, lime stones, bricks, blocks, rocks, and the like. These materials are mostly inhomogeneous and contain cracks of variable sizes, especially those with age, as are those used in Philippine structures. Since most of these structures are of cultural significance to the country, their preservation must be given importance. Their preservation would start in an evaluation of the structure in a way that would not damage the structure. As a method of evaluation of these structures, this research aimed to develop a correlation between mechanical properties of materials such as Young's modulus of elasticity and uniaxial compressive strength which are usually determined using destructive tests, and nondestructive parameters, such as ultrasonic pulse velocity and wave attenuation. This method would allow future evaluation of masonry structures in a nondestructive way which would in turn, preserve their historical and cultural worth. Ultrasonic testing was conducted to determine different wave characteristics of different masonry materials commonly used in old Philippine structures.

Capture and Quantification of Deterioration Progression in Concrete Bridge Decks through Periodical NDE Surveys,Nenad Gucunski; Brian M. Pailes; Jinyoung Kim; Hoda Azari; Kien Dinh,2016,10.1061/(asce)is.1943-555x.0000321,Journal of Infrastructure Systems,"Monitoring the condition of concrete bridge decks is essential because bridge decks are deteriorating faster than other bridge components. This study concentrated on bridge deck condition assessment using complementary nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. The assessment had three main components: evaluation of the corrosive environment and corrosion processes, concrete degradation evaluation, and assessment with respect to deck delamination. Five NDE techniques were used: impact echo (IE) to detect and characterize delamination, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to describe the corrosive environment, measurement of the concrete cover and description of its overall condition, half-cell potential (HCP) to assess corrosion activity, ultrasonic surface waves (USW) to describe concrete quality, and electrical resistivity (ER) to estimate corrosion rate. The ability of NDE methods to objectively characterize deterioration progression is illustrated by the results from four NDE surveys of a bridge in Virginia during a period of five and a half years. The results, which include condition maps and condition indices, demonstrate the ability of NDE technologies to accurately and objectively detect and quantify deterioration progression.

The amount of corrosion was varied in the rebars with different levels of mass loss ranging from 0% to 45%. The corroded rebars were then placed into three different oil emulsion tanks having different dielectric properties similar to concrete. The maximum amplitudes from the corroded bars were recorded.

Acoustic emission monitoring for bond integrity evaluation of reinforced concrete under pull-out tests,Ahmed A. Abouhussien; Assem A. A. Hassan,2016,10.1177/1369433216678864,Advances in Structural Engineering,"This article presents the results of an experimental investigation on the application of acoustic emission technique for monitoring the steel-to-concrete bond integrity of reinforced concrete structures. A series of direct pull-out tests were performed on 54 reinforced concrete unconfined prism samples with variable rebar diameter (10, 20, and 35 mm), embedded length (50, 100, and 200 mm), and concrete cover (20, 30, and 40 mm). The samples were tested under incrementally increasing monotonic loading while being continuously monitored via attached acoustic emission sensors. These sensors were utilized to acquire different acoustic emission signal parameters emitted throughout the tests until failure. Also, an acoustic emission intensity analysis was implemented on acoustic emission signal strength data to quantify the damage resulting from loss of bond in all tested specimens. This analysis employed the signal strength of all recorded acoustic emission hits to develop two additional parameters: historic index ( H ( t)) and severity ( S r ). The results of bond behavior, mode of failure, and free end slip were compared with the recorded acoustic emission data. The results showed that the cumulative number of hits, cumulative signal strength, H ( t), and S r had a good correlation with different stages of bond damage from de-bonding/micro-cracking until bond splitting failure and bar slippage, which caused cover cracking or delamination. The analysis of cumulative signal strength and H ( t) curves enabled early identification of two progressive stages of bond degradation (micro-cracking and macro-cracking) and recognized the various modes of failure of the tested specimens. The variations of bar diameter, concrete cover, and embedded length yielded significant impacts on both the bond behavior and acoustic emission activities.

Development of stiffness and ultrasonic pulse velocity of fatigue loaded concrete,Christoph von der Haar; Steffen Marx,2016,10.1002/suco.201600007,Structural Concrete,"Abstract Damage processes in fatigue loaded concrete structures depend on the number and amplitude of the load cycles applied. Damage evolution is linked to a reduction in concrete stiffness, and it is thought that this reduction causes stress redistributions at component level which have a favourable impact on the service life of a structure. Until now, the stiffness reduction and stress redistribution have never been successfully measured in laboratory tests or in situ. It is only known that the real service life is longer than the calculated one and that indicators of stiffness reduction, such as component deflection, increase with the number of load cycles applied. Ultrasonic measurement techniques are considered to be well suited to detecting degradation processes caused by cyclic loading. It is expected that the stiffness reduction in fatigue loaded concrete structures can be recorded reliably with ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements. In the light of this, fatigue tests were performed on small‐scale concrete specimens. The aims of the tests were to understand the correlation between the observed stiffness degradation of the specimens and the results of ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements and to estimate the potential for using ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements in continuous structural health monitoring.",27,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1002/suco.201600007,https://openalex.org/W2279476522,Tasks: deterioration

Electrochemical Characterization of Solid Ag/AgCl Reference Electrode with Different Electrolytes for Corrosion Monitoring of Steel in Concrete,Ming Jin; Linhua Jiang; Jinxia Xu; Hongqiang Chu; Debiao Tao,2016,10.5796/electrochemistry.84.383,Electrochemistry,"Solid Ag/AgCl reference electrodes (RE) with different electrolytes were assembled and characterized in concrete.

In addition, 4.18 M AgCl RE exhibited the minimum potential drift, the smallest temperature coefficient value and the best reversibility. These corrosion parameters such as rebar potential, corrosion current density (Icorr) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) obtained for steel with respect to these embedded AgCl REs could clearly differentiate the active condition of steel from the passive condition. Besides, Icorr and Rct obtained for steel with respect to external SCE were usually 2 or 3 times larger than these embedded AgCl REs.

Investigation of infrared thermography for subsurface damage detection of concrete structures,Shuhei Hiasa,2016,,STARS (University of Central Florida),"Deterioration of road infrastructure arises from aging and various other factors. Consequently, inspection and maintenance have been a serious worldwide problem. In the United States, degradation of concrete bridge decks is a widespread problem among several bridge components. In order to prevent the impending degradation of bridges, periodic inspection and proper maintenance are indispensable. However, the transportation system faces unprecedented challenges because the number of aging bridges is increasing under limited resources, both in terms of budget and personnel. Therefore, innovative technologies and processes that enable bridge owners to inspect and evaluate bridge conditions more effectively and efficiently with less human and monetary resources are desired. Traditionally, qualified engineers and inspectors implemented hammer sounding and/or chain drag, and visual inspection for concrete bridge deck evaluations, but these methods require substantial field labor, experience, and lane closures for bridge deck inspections. Under these circumstances, Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques such as computer vision-based crack detection, impact echo (IE), ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and infrared thermography (IRT) have been developed to inspect and monitor aging and deteriorating structures rapidly and effectively. However, no single method can detect all kinds of defects in concrete structures as well as the traditional inspection combination of visual and sounding inspections; hence, there is still no international standard NDE methods for concrete bridges, although significant progress has been made up to the present. This research presents the potential to reduce a burden of bridge inspections, especially for bridge decks, in place of traditional chain drag and hammer sounding methods by IRT with the combination of computer vision-based technology. However, there were still several challenges and uncertainties in using IRT for bridge inspections. This study revealed those challenges and uncertainties, and explored those solutions, proper methods and ideal conditions for applying IRT in order to enhance the usability, reliability and accuracy of IRT for concrete bridge inspections. Throughout the study, detailed investigations of IRT are presented. Firstly, three different types of infrared (IR) cameras were compared under active IRT conditions in the laboratory to examine the effect of photography angle on IRT along with the specifications of cameras. The results showed that when IR images are taken from a certain angle, each camera shows different temperature readings. However, since each IR camera can capture temperature differences between sound and delaminated areas, they have a potential to detect delaminated areas under a given condition in spite of camera specifications even when they are utilized from a certain angle. Furthermore, a more objective data analysis method than just comparing IR images was explored to assess IR data. Secondly, coupled structural mechanics and heat transfer models of concrete blocks with artificial delaminations used for a field test were developed and analyzed to explore sensitive parameters for effective utilization of IRT. After these finite element (FE) models were validated, critical parameters and factors of delamination detectability such as the size of delamination (area, thickness and volume), ambient temperature and sun loading condition (different season), and the depth of delamination from the surface were explored. This study presents that the area of delamination is much more influential in the detectability of IRT than thickness and volume. It is also found that there is no significant difference depending on the season when IRT is employed. Then, FE model simulations were used to obtain the temperature differences between sound and delaminated areas in order to process IR data. By using this method, delaminated areas of concrete slabs could be detected more objectively than by judging the color contrast of IR images. However, it was also found that the boundary condition affects the accuracy of this method, and the effect varies depending on the data collection time. Even though there are some limitations, integrated use of FE model simulation with IRT showed that the combination can be reduce other pre-tests on bridges, reduce the need to have access to the bridge and also can help automate the IRT data analysis process for concrete bridge deck inspections. After that, the favorable time windows for concrete bridge deck inspections by IRT were explored through field experiment and FE model simulations. Based on the numerical simulations and experimental IRT results, higher temperature differences in the day were observed from both results around noontime and nighttime, although IRT is affected by sun loading during the daytime heating cycle resulting in possible misdetections. Furthermore, the numerical simulations show that the maximum effect occurs at night during the nighttime cooling cycle, and the temperature difference decreases gradually from that time to a few hours after sunrise of the next day. Thus, it can be concluded that the nighttime application of IRT is the most suitable time window for bridge decks. Furthermore, three IR cameras with different specifications were compared to explore several factors affecting the utilization of IRT in regards to subsurface damage detection in concrete structures, specifically when the IRT is utilized for high-speed bridge deck inspections at normal driving speeds under field laboratory conditions. The results show that IRT can detect up to 2.54 cm delamination from the concrete surface at any time period. This study revealed two important factors of camera specifications for high-speed inspection by IRT as shorter integration time and higher pixel resolution. Finally, a real bridge was scanned by three different types of IR cameras and the results were compared with other NDE technologies that were implemented by other researchers on the same bridge. When compared at fully documented locations with 8 concrete cores, a high-end IR camera with cooled detector distinguished sound and delaminated areas accurately. Furthermore, indicated location and shape of delaminations by three IR cameras were compared to other NDE methods from past research, and the result revealed that the cooled camera showed almost identical shapes to other NDE methods including chain drag. It should be noted that the data were collected at normal driving speed without any lane closures, making it a more practical and faster method than other NDE technologies. It was also presented that the factor most likely to affect high-speed application is integration time of IR camera as well as the conclusion of the field laboratory test. The notable contribution of this study for the improvement of IRT is that this study revealed the preferable conditions for IRT, specifically for high-speed scanning of concrete bridge decks. This study shows that IRT implementation under normal driving speeds has high potential to evaluate concrete bridge decks accurately without any lane closures much more quickly than other NDE methods, if a cooled camera equipped with higher pixel resolution is used during nighttime. Despite some limitations of IRT, the data collection speed is a great advantage for periodic bridge inspections compared to other NDE methods. Moreover, there is a high possibility to reduce inspection time, labor and budget drastically if high-speed bridge deck scanning by the combination of IRT and computer vision-based technology becomes a standard bridge deck inspection method. Therefore, the author recommends combined application of the high-speed scanning combination and other NDE methods to optimize bridge deck inspections.",19,article,True,https://openalex.org/W2571073274,https://openalex.org/W2571073274,Tasks: defects

The probability that a defect, in this case represented by a corroding (anodically acting) area of the reinforcement steel, can be detected was calculated in dependency to electrolytic resistance of concrete, to the concrete cover, and to the grid size chosen for inspection. If parts exposed to different moisture condition are evaluated in one data set, the reliability of corrosion detection can be strongly impaired.

This paper presents an experiment conducted to investigate the influence of freeze-thaw cycles on the rebar corrosion in reinforced concrete. The purpose of this paper is to provide fundamental information about rebar corrosion under frost environment and improvement measures. Design/methodology/approach – The related elastic modulus and compressive strength of different concrete specimens were measured after different freeze-thaw cycles. The accelerated rebar corrosion test was carried out after different freeze-thaw cycles; additionally, the value of calomel half-cell potential was determined. The actual rebar corrosion appearance was checked to prove the accuracy of the results of calomel half-cell potential. Findings – The results show that frost damage aggravates the rebar corrosion rate and degree under freeze-thaw environment; furthermore, the results become more obvious with the freeze-thaw cycles increasing. Mixing the air-entrained agent into fresh concrete to prepare air-entrained concrete, increasing the cover thickness and processing the surface of concrete with a waterproofing agent can significantly improve the resistance to rebar corrosion. From the actual appearance of rebar corrosion, the results of calomel half-cell potential can well reflect the actual rebar corrosion in reinforced concrete. Originality/value – The durability of reinforced concrete is mainly determined on chloride penetration that brings about rebar corrosion in chloride environments. Furthermore, the degradation of concrete durability becomes more serious in the harsh environment. As the concrete exposure to the freeze-thaw cycles environment, the freeze-thaw cycles accelerate the concrete damage, and the penetration of chloride into the concrete becomes easier because of the growing pore and crack sizes. In addition, rebar corrosion caused by chloride is one of the major forms of environmental attack on reinforced concrete. The tests conducted in this paper will describe the rebar corrosion in reinforced concrete under freeze-thaw environment.",18,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1108/acmm-11-2014-1461,https://openalex.org/W2293565270,"Tasks: strength, deterioration"

PZT Based Smart Aggregate for Unified Health Monitoring of RC Structures,Suraj N. Khante; Shruti R. Gedam,2016,10.4236/ojce.2016.61005,Open Journal of Civil Engineering,"The most familiar civil engineering structure is reinforced concrete (RC) structure. Performance of structure undergoes changes during their service life with time. Thus, it is of great concern to monitor the health of RC structure. Structural health monitoring (SHM) is the art of detecting the changes in structure that influences its performance. Various techniques to monitor the health of structure are broadly studied worldwide. PZT based smart aggregate can play an effective role as an advanced tool in the development of structural health monitoring. This research work contributes for proposing a more generous Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) technique for structural health monitoring by using smart materials. If performance of a structure deviates from the design parameters with time, appropriate and effective maintenance is required. Considering the relevant need of RC structures, a more sensitive and cost-effective approach by using Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) technique has been proposed for implementation in real-life situations. In general, surface bonded PZT transducer is used for SHM. Since PZT transducers are of very small dimension and brittle in nature, for consistent characteristics, they should be protected from severe environmental condition and other external interruptions. For this reason, PZT transducer is embedded in structure at the time of construction and manufacturing of the embedded transducer is simple. The proposed EMI technique assesses the health of RC structures more rationally by embedding PZT transducer in the structure, whose health is to be monitored over the user specified preset frequency range. The conductance and susceptance signatures are acquired by using LCR meter. At any future point of time, when it is desired to assess the health of structure, the conductance and susceptance signatures are acquired and further utilized for damage detection and quantification.

The study concentrates on the condition assessment of bridge decks using complementary NDE techniques. The assessment has three main components: assessment of corrosive environment and corrosion processes, and assessment with respect to the deck delamination. The study concentrates on a complementary use of five NDE techniques: impact echo (IE) to detect and characterize delamination, ground penetrating radar (GPR) to describe the corrosive environment and detect delamination, and electrical resistivity (ER) to estimate the corrosion rate by measuring concrete resistivity. The ability of the NDE methods to objectively characterize deterioration progression is illustrated by the results from NDE surveys of 10 bridges of different ages in New Jersey during a period of one year. The deterioration progression is illustrated by condition maps and condition indices.

Evaluation of Modulus of Elasticity by Non-Destructive Method of Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Concrete,,2016,10.15242/ijacebs.c0416019,International Journal of Advances in Chemical Engineering and Biological Sciences,"Plain, unreinforced concrete is a brittle material, with a low tensile strength, limited ductility and little resistance to cracking.In order to improve the inherent tensile strength of concrete there is a need of multidirectional and closely spaced reinforcement, which can be provided in the form of randomly distributed fibers Fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) is a composite material consisting of cement, sand, coarse aggregate, water and fibers.In this composite material, short discrete fibers are randomly distributed throughout the concrete mass.The behavioral efficiency of this composite material is far superior to that of plain concrete and many other construction materials of equal cost.The present experimental study considers the effect of steel fibers and polypropylene fiber on the modulus of elasticity of concrete.Hook end steel fibers of length 5 cm and 3 cm at volume fraction of 0.25%, 0.5 % and 1% were used.Also polypropylene fiber of length 12, 6, 3 mm at volume fraction 0.1, 0.25 and 0.4 % were used.Fifteen mixtures has been prepared to evaluate the effect of fiber on modulus of elasticity of concrete.Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and resonant frequency methods which are two non-destructive testing techniques have been used to measure the elastic properties of fiber reinforced concrete This study found that ultrasonic wave propagation is the most reliable, easy and cost effective testing technique to use in the determination of the elastic properties of the FRC mix used in this study Keyword-fiber reinforced concrete(FRC), polypropylene fiber, resonance, ultrasonic pulse",7,article,True,https://doi.org/10.15242/ijacebs.c0416019,https://openalex.org/W2604403629,Tasks: strength
Untersuchungen zur Steifigkeit und Ultraschallgeschwindigkeit dynamisch beanspruchter Betonproben,Christoph von der Haar; Steffen Marx,2016,10.1002/best.201500059,Beton- und Stahlbetonbau,"Abstract In dynamisch beanspruchten Betonstrukturen treten Schädigungsprozesse auf, die sich in Abhängigkeit vom Beanspruchungsniveau und von der Lastzyklenzahl entwickeln. Mit der Schädigungsentwicklung nimmt die Steifigkeit des Betons ab, wodurch erwartet wird, dass sie Spannungsumlagerungen auf Bauteilebene hervorruft, welche die Lebensdauer der Bauwerke günstig beeinflusst. Die Messung derartiger Steifigkeitsdegradationen und Spannungsumlagerungen ist bislang in‐situ als auch unter Laborbedingungen nicht gelungen. Es konnte in der Regel lediglich festgestellt werden, dass die reale Lebensdauer größer ist als die rechnerische bzw. Indikatoren wie die Bauteildurchbiegung mit der Lastwechselzahl zunehmen. Im Gegenzug scheinen Ultraschallmessverfahren für die Beschreibung derartiger Degradationsprozesse gut geeignet zu sein. So wird vermutet, dass anhand von Ultraschallgeschwindigkeitsmessungen die Steifigkeitsdegradation dynamisch beanspruchter Betonbauteile erfasst werden kann. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurden Ermüdungsversuche an kleinformatigen Betonproben durchgeführt. Ziel war es, die Steifigkeitsdegradation der Probekörper und die Ergebnisse von Ultraschalllaufzeitmessungen vergleichend gegenüber zu stellen, um Aussagen über deren Korrelation zu treffen sowie Anwendungspotenziale für ein Lebensdauermonitoring zu identifizieren. Investigations on stiffness and ultrasonic pulse velocity of concrete under fatigue loads In dynamically loaded concrete structures damage processes occur which depend on the stress level and the number of applied load cycles. The damage evolution is linked with the stiffness reduction of the concrete. It is expected that the stiffness reduction causes stress redistributions at the component level and affects the service life of the structure favorable. But until now the stiffness reduction and the stress redistribution has not been measured in laboratory tests and in situ successfully. It was only found that the real service life is greater than the calculated one or indicators for the stiffness reduction like the component deflection increases with the number of applied load cycles. In return ultrasound measurement methods are handled to be well suited for the description of such degradation processes. It is supposed that on the basis of ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements the stiffness reduction of dynamically loaded concrete structures can be observed reliable. Against this background, fatigue tests were performed on small‐sized concrete specimens. The aim of the tests was to compare the stiffness reduction of the specimen and the results of ultrasonic transmission measurements to make statements about their correlation and to identify the potential for a lifetime monitoring.",7,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1002/best.201500059,https://openalex.org/W2292733078,Tasks: deterioration
Evaluation of internal damage in reinforced concrete elements using ultrasonic tomography,Hajin Choi,2016,,Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign),"Quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) of the concrete infrastructure has become an important national issue, especially because construction inaccuracies and invisible internal defects can result in unexpected structural response and failure. In order to evaluate the condition of an existing concrete structure, non-destructive testing (NDT) has been widely used as an assessment tool. Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) is an efficient method to characterize the condition of concrete elements, and tomographic imaging is a powerful tool for visually identifying internal damage. However, the implementation of UPV data within a tomographic imaging scheme for application to full-scale concrete (RC) structures has not been realized to date because of practical and technological restrictions. &#13;\n&#13;\nIn this dissertation, some of those barriers are overcome by using contactless air-coupled ultrasonic sensors in a scanning test configuration to acquire large amounts of ultrasonic data to create ultrasonic tomograms of large-scale concrete structures. The development of the testing system is described. The measurements are carried out using an automated robotic scanning frame using new sensing technology. Image reconstruction algorithms, including synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) and algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), are reviewed and evaluated for application to imaging of full-scale RC columns. The performance of the data collection system and selected optimal imaging approach are verified through tests on a RC column test sample containing embedded artificial defects. The obtained tomographic images are compared with those from a commercially available ultrasonic imaging device. A comprehensive visualization scheme to characterize the column test sample, based on fusion of integrated ultrasonic tomography and 3-D computer vision, is presented. Such integrated visualization provides holistic characterization of the test sample. Next, the utility of attenuation tomography for enhanced damage detection is evaluated, both through numerical simulation and experimental studies. &#13;\n&#13;\nFinally, the developed ultrasonic tomographic testing system is applied to full-scale RC columns and slab-beam-column sub-assemblages subjected to simulated earthquake loads. Different concrete types, including normal reinforced concrete and high performance fiber-reinforced concrete, and seismic different loading schemes are considered. Comparisons of ultrasonic tomograms and strain gauge data illustrate the potential for velocity and attenuation tomography to monitor internal damage progression of structural RC elements both at global and local levels.",4,article,True,https://openalex.org/W2607114558,https://openalex.org/W2607114558,Tasks: defects

The Economy of Preventive Maintenance of Concrete Bridges Due to Corrosion,Haotian Zhang,2016,,Syracuse University Libraries (Syracuse University),"The current practice for physical evaluation and delayed maintenance of deteriorated concrete bridge is fundamentally wrong. This research presents a new approach for the evaluation of the condition states of steel reinforced concrete bridge members, which is based on their chemical conditions instead of the physical deficiencies such as cracks and delamination. Using the proposed chemical based inspection approach, a more effective and economic preventive maintenance plan could be achieved. The available non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods and preventive maintenance measure are identified. Since the chloride induced corrosion is the major factor that dictates the service life of the steel reinforced bridge element, a refined equation for estimation of the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions into concrete is proposed.\nA Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model that accounts for time-dependent and temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient was developed and verified against experimental data produced by several researchers. The results of the numerical analysis showed good agreement with experimental data. After validation against experimental data, the FEA model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the preventive maintenance measures, such as surface sealers and overlays. The chloride profiles derived from the FEA model was then used as an indicator to select appropriate preventive maintenance measures at the right time based on the chloride concentration at the surface of the steel. A simplified concrete bridge deck element is selected to compare the life-cycle cost of a bridge deck with different concrete mix design and different maintenance strategies under various exposure conditions.\nFor cost-effective management of concrete highway bridges, the following measures should be taken, depending on the exposure conditions:\n1.\tFor severe exposure conditions, such as coastal area or cold regions that require a large amount of deicing salt, carbon steel reinforced bridge decks have a short service life. Therefore, a well-planned preventive maintenance strategy needs to be implemented in order to postpone or eliminate the needs of major rehabilitation and replacement. In such case, the use of stainless steel could be the most economical solution for the long run. In addition, the use of integrated overlay made of high performance concrete or cathodic protection systems may reduce the life-cycle cost based on a 75-year expected service life.\n2.\tFor moderate exposures, the use of overlays and surface sealers has been deemed cost-effective. However, the life-cycle cost is very sensitive for sealer application since it needs to be reapplied frequently. Thus, the effectiveness of the sealer should be closely monitored by the Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods.\n3.\tFor mild exposures, the corrosion may not be the most critical deterioration mechanism for the bridge deck element. The riding surface of the bridge deck needs to be replaced periodically due to other deterioration mechanisms such as erosion, fatigue cracks, etc.\nIn conclusion, this research shows that it is not only economical, but also necessary to allocate more funds to perform in-depth, chemical oriented non-destructive tests and active preventive maintenance.",2,article,True,https://openalex.org/W2586953845,https://openalex.org/W2586953845,Tasks: deterioration
Feasibility of Infrared Thermography for Bridge Deck Inspection Without Lane Closure and the Uncertainties - Preliminary Report -,Shuhei Hiasa; F. Necati Çatbaş; Masato Matsumoto; Koji Mitani,2016,,Transportation Research Board 95th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"Aging and deterioration of bridges are becoming serious problems worldwide. Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods, such as Infrared (IR) and High Definition (HD) cameras, have been developing for high-speed inspection without any lane closures to quantify rapid deterioration progress due to the aging of bridges and increase of maintenance budget. However, accuracy and reliability of bridge deck condition evaluation by IR Thermography (IRT) at highway speed is still insufficient. In this study, IR images of a bridge deck in service were taken while driving with three different types of IR cameras, and the results were compared with other NDE methods conducted by other researchers at the same bridge. The results proved that IRT with a cooled camera has a possibility to perform damage detection for concrete bridge decks with certain accuracy and reliability even if it is utilized while driving at highway speed without lane closure, and the performance level is almost similar to other NDE methods under static situation. In terms of application of IRT with an uncooled camera for high speed inspection, it showed relatively larger area of damage indications and higher False Positive misdetection ratio. Since the number of core samples and the area of test field were very limited, more research is required to further evaluate the conclusions of this paper.

Deterioration can result in loss of strength and unsafe conditions of the structures. NPP contain a variety of concrete structures that their structural performance of which is essential to the safety of the plant. Early detection of concrete structural deterioration in NPP is critical issue considering the consequence that they can eventually lead to. To ensure the safety and integrity of NPP, non-destructive testing (NDT) is carried out during the in-service life time. However, current NDT faces several challenges: (i) the NDT can be performed only during the revision time and the test process is time limited, (ii) the accuracy of the test devices, (iii) the compatibility of different NDT methods to the concrete structures and their deterioration mechanisms, (iv) the global uniformity of the NDT test methods and (v) the creditability of the test results and analysis.

Critical Review of the Current Inspection and Maintenance Practices for Concrete Bridges,Haotian Zhang; Riyad S. Aboutaha,2016,,Transportation Research Board 95th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"A concrete bridge would cost less to maintain and safely serves its full design service life, if not longer, when deterioration mechanisms are prevented or controlled. The current inspection practice gives a good assessment of the condition rating of the bridge elements based on their physical conditions. If followed by proper maintenance measures, it is likely that the bridge would serve its full design service life. However, preventive maintenance actions could be used more efficiently before the formation of any physical deterioration, which could only be determined through proper assessment of the chemical condition of the bridge elements. Therefore, chemical Nondestructive Evaluation should be utilized more widely as bases for inspection and assessment of bridge condition. A chemical Nondestructive Evaluation followed by an active preventive maintenance scheme may prevent deterioration mechanism from starting, or at least slows it down at a very early stage. This paper presents a critical constructive review of the current inspection and maintenance manuals by various transportation agencies. As a result, more active chemical Nondestructive Tests (NDT) are recommended for routine inspections to evaluate the chemical conditions of the concrete bridge elements, based on which a more precise numerical deterioration model could be derived. The NDT results could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of maintenance measures, and guides the future maintenance work. Cost-effective preventive maintenance measures could be selected and scheduled systematically which may lead to an optimal life-cycle cost throughout the service life of the concrete bridge.",0,article,False,https://openalex.org/W2340955126,https://openalex.org/W2340955126,Tasks: deterioration

In the recent years, non-destructive testing (NDT) is becoming increasingly essential for reliable and affordable quality control and integrity assessment not only during the construction of new concrete structures, but also for the existing ones.

Reliability of Rebound Hammer Test in Concrete Compressive Strength Estimation,,2015,10.15242/ijaaee.c1114040,International Journal of Advances in Agricultural & Environmental Engineering,"The reliability of the non-destructive Schmidt Hammer Test as a means of estimating the compressive strength of concrete is investigated by testing three groups of concrete cube specimens. The first group was exposed to cycles of alternate drying and wetting in brackish water; the second group, to continuous immersion in brackish water; and the third (control) group, to normal room condition. Results show that the average Schmidt Hammer Rebound Number (RN) for samples in the first and second group is significantly less than that of the third group. These indicate the reliability of the Schmidt Hammer Test in predicting the reducing effect of exposure to brackish water on the compressive strength of concrete. Moreover, results show that in each of the three groups, the average estimated compressive strength of concrete based on Schmidt Hammer Test (using the rebound curve provided by the manufacturer of the device) underestimates the average actual compressive strengths based on direct compression test. Thus, in a quick strength and safety assessment of existing concrete structures, the Schmidt Hammer Test is fairly reliable in determining whether the further use of the structure would still be safe, but may not be so in concluding whether the use is no longer safe. In the latter case, the Schmidt Hammer Test should be supplemented by core sampling and testing. O determine the strength of concrete in existing structures, cylinder specimens are usually taken from the structures and brought to laboratories where they are loaded to failure to obtain actual compressive strength. This procedure is the most accurate way but it requires considerable time and expenses. In order to assess in-situ concrete strength in a faster manner, non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques have been developed and adopted. These techniques estimate the strength of existing structures by measuring some concrete properties other than its strength, and then relate these properties to strength or other mechanical properties of concrete (1).

Toughness behaviour of high‐performance lightweight foamed concrete reinforced with hybrid fibres,Eethar Thanon Dawood; Ali Jihad Hamad,2015,10.1002/suco.201400087,Structural Concrete,"Abstract Lightweight foamed concrete (LWFC) is a concrete having structural strength with lightweight density and high flowability. High‐performance lightweight foamed concrete (HPLWFC) is used in modern concrete technology and intensively in the construction of high‐rise buildings, long‐span concrete structures, road sub‐bases and other applications. The present work deals with the fresh and hardened properties of LWFC. The fresh properties of LWFC are measured with the flow and fresh density tests. The hardened properties tests include compressive strength, flexural strength, flexural toughness, static modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption and oven‐dry density. In addition, the study focuses mainly on the effect of the fibres added to LWFC mixes. Two types of fibre have been used: glass fibres and polypropylene fibres, and the combination of glass fibres (GF) and polypropylene fibres (PPF) to obtain hybrid fibres (GF+PPF).This study also focuses on the effect of hybrid fibres on the flexural toughness of HPLWFC. Trial mixes have been used to choose the optimum mix. The definition for choosing the best mix depended on three parameters: oven‐dry density, flowability and compressive strength. The volume fraction of glass and polypropylene fibres are 0.06, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 %, and 0.2, 0.6, 1 and 1.4 % respectively. The percentages of hybrid fibres “GF + PPF” are “0.2 + 0.6”, “0.4 + 0.6”, “0.2 + 1” and “0.4 + 1” %. The results show that the greatest increments in the compressive and flexural strengths of LWFC are 51 and 21 % respectively due to the use of 0.6 % glass fibres. On the other hand, LWFC reinforced with polypropylene fibres exhibits only a minor increase in compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths. The best percentage of hybrid fibres yielding the highest increment in LWFC is “0.4 % GF + 0.6 % PPF”. The results of flexural toughness tests indicate that the polypropylene fibres denote a higher efficiency in the flexural toughness than is the case with glass fibres. The flexural toughness results increase with the volume fraction of the fibres. The hybridization shows the best flexural toughness values due to the cooperative work of the glass and polypropylene fibres boost the performance of flexural toughness in pre‐crack and post‐crack zones. Therefore, the use of 0.4 %GF + 1 %PPF gives the best results in this regard.",49,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1002/suco.201400087,https://openalex.org/W2115834321,Tasks: strength

To evaluate the potential of acoustic emission monitoring for this application, long term corrosion monitoring tests were performed on specimens that were representative of internal and external posttensioning methods. Corrosion was induced in the specimens by adding chlorides to the grout and by performing wet/dry cycling with NaCl solution. The corrosion process was monitored by half-cell potential measurements (HCP) and acoustic emission (AE). Results show that AE has the ability to detect corrosion damage in the PT specimens with similar accuracy to HCP measurements.

Porosity of Self-compacting Concrete,Abdulkader El Mir; Salem Georges Nehme,2015,10.1016/j.proeng.2015.10.071,Procedia Engineering,"The construction industry demands more durable concrete with high performance. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) is developing gradually to meet many aspects of construction technology, especially reinforced concrete. On the other hand, durability properties still need some enhancements particularly in term of microstructure properties. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on non-destructive testing of self-compacting concrete. Question arises: are the contexts on the strength of conventional normal concrete (NC) extendable on the strength of SCC? Laboratory tests were carried out at the BME, Department of Construction Materials and Technologies. Aim of the research was to determine the service life of SCC with respect to normal concrete. Constant and variable parameters were determined to the concrete mixes. Constant parameters were: type of cement CEM III-A 32.5 N-MS and grading curve of the aggregate. Variable parameters were: water-cement ratio, content of cement, content of limestone powder. The purpose of this study is to analyze the implementation of economical non-pozzolanic filler additive (limestone) into the concrete matrix of SCC. Normal and Self-compacting concrete mixes were prepared to reach a correlation between porosity indicators. Results indicated that SCC mixtures had more reliable rebound index and lower total porosity values than NC; whereas water absorption in SCC was found to show considerably higher values than referred NC mixes.",22,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2015.10.071,https://openalex.org/W1866575492,Tasks: deterioration
Research on residual bending capacities of used wood members based on the correlation between non-destructive testing results and the mechanical properties of wood,Jin Zhang; Qingfeng Xu; Yixiang Xu; Ming Zhang,2015,10.1631/jzus.a1400276,Journal of Zhejiang University. Science A,"To quantitatively assess the residual strength of wood members after rot and infestation using non-destructive testing (NDT), the multi-point Resistograph method was applied to test six used wood beams with initial imperfections. Each wood beam was then divided into a shorter segment for mechanical tests and a longer one for bending capacity tests. With the help of finite element analysis using ANSYS, bending capacity is predicted by taking account of the initial imperfections. Results show that there is a significant correlation between drill resistance values and strengths for small specimens. Therefore, the strengths of wood at other measurement points may be obtained through drill resistance values. The beams showed a near linear behaviour up to the maximum load with poor ductility performance in bending capacity tests. It can also be found that the effects of initial imperfections on failure modes and ultimate loads are significant. The lateral side of specimen BA1 has serious infestation and the bottom of BA2 has a long longitudinal crack, the ultimate bearing capacities of these specimens are respectively only 67.6% and 64.8% of BA3, which has fewer cracks. BB1 and BB3 have knots at the bottom and their ultimate bearing capacities are respectively 83.9% and 81.0% of BB2, which has fewer cracks as well. Furthermore, there is quite good agreement between test results and numerical prediction using strength values obtained by NDT results. Therefore, the bending capacity of used wood beams can be obtained using NDT, which can provide the basis for the protection and retrofitting of wood structures.",21,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1631/jzus.a1400276,https://openalex.org/W927271248,Tasks: strength
Nondestructive evaluation of notched cracks in mortars by nonlinear ultrasonic technique,Jun Chen; Jun Ren; Tingyuan Yin,2015,10.1080/10589759.2015.1078331,Nondestructive Testing And Evaluation,"In this paper, a nonlinear ultrasonic technique is used to nondestructively characterise concentrated defects in cement-based materials. Cracks are artificially notched in mortar samples and five different crack widths are used to simulate increased damage of samples. The relative ratio of second harmonic amplitude to the square of fundamental ultrasonic signal amplitude is defined as the damage indicator of the nonlinear ultrasonic technique, which is measured for mortar samples in conjunction with a typical linear nondestructive evaluation parameter – ultrasonic pulse velocity. It is found that both linear and nonlinear damage parameters have a good correlation with the change of crack width, while the nonlinearity parameter shows a better sensitivity to the width increase. In addition, the nonlinearity parameter presents an exponential increase with the crack growth, indicating an accelerating nonlinear ultrasonic response of materials to increased internal damage in the late phase. The results demonstrate that the nonlinear ultrasonic technique based on the second harmonic principle keeps the high sensitivity to the isolated cracks in cement-based materials, similarly to the case of distributed cracks in previous studies. The developed technique could thus be a useful experimental tool for the assessment of concentrated damage of concrete structures.",21,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1080/10589759.2015.1078331,https://openalex.org/W2293303191,Tasks: defects

So, experiments were accomplished on polymer-mortar composite materials where the cement was partially replaced by various volume fractions of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles (0%, 6%, 12% and 17%). The specimens were tested by destructive and non-destructive testing and for chemical resistance to acid solutions at different concentrations. From this study, it was found that the PET-modified mortars exposed to aggressive environments showed better resistance to chemical attack than unmodified one without substantially affecting the mechanical strength in tap water and UPV values decrease as the proportion of PET waste in the mix increases. The addition of PET to the modified mortars, means reducing the penetration of aggressive agents. The formations which appear such as different calcium salts were determined by TG/dTG analysis.

Numerical investigation on guided wave-based damage identification and severity estimation of timber utility poles,Jianchun Li; Yang Yu; Ning Yan; Ulrike Dackermann; Bijan Samali,2015,,Open Publications Of UTS Scholars (University of Technology Sydney),"© 2015, International Society for Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure, ISHMII. All rights reserved. Over the past decades, various non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been applied for the damage detection and condition assessment of the timber poles. Among them, the guided wave (GW) based methods, which measure stress wave propagation in the poles, are often considered a simple and cost-effective tool which can be potentially used in practice. However, due to the lack of in-depth understanding on wave propagation in timber structures, these methods are generally based on over-simplified assumptions and therefore failed to provide the reliable results. In this paper, the studies on damage identification and severity estimation of timber utility poles were conducted based on the GW-based NDT method. First, wavelet packet energy and natural frequency features of the poles are extracted from the measured GW signals. Novel index was proposed based on such features to determine the damage type of the tested pole. Once damage type is determined, the corresponding models are adopted using the genetic algorithm to describe the relationship between damage severity and feature index. Finally, the numerical results of the timber poles with different damage types and severities are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.",0,article,False,https://openalex.org/W2243679784,https://openalex.org/W2243679784,Tasks: defects
Structural assessment of existing timber roof structures for green roofs in Rotterdam,L.H.C.J. Rovers,2015,,Research Repository (Delft University of Technology),"Green roofs, also known as vegetation roofs, are becoming very popular for residents of houses or apartments and for good reasons. Vegetation on rooftops have many benefits on global and local level. Expectations show that the climate change will lead to heavier storms and causes the sewers in Rotterdam to overflow. Hence, the municipality of Rotterdam wishes to apply this special type of roof on a large scale to buffer rainwater which can gradually be discharged. Although the concept of a green roof is nothing new, applying them on this large scale to solve an urban problem makes it an interesting topic. Two types can be distinguished: intensive and extensive green roofs. Both types are able to retain rainwater but can be distinguished in their function. Intensive green roofs allow for recreation and gardening while extensive green roofs have an aesthetical function. The municipality of Rotterdam and its citizens both want green roofs instead of bitumen roofs, however they neither have the time nor the knowledge to determine whether their timber roof structure is suitable for this extra ballast. A first simplified calculation indicated that there was not enough strength to resists this load. If no research is done then Rotterdam will only be able to have vegetation on structures of steel or concrete while timber roofs are commonly present. In an ideal future every roof in Rotterdam is a green roof. This thesis researches the residual capacity of flat timber roofs by reducing the uncertainties associated with the strength. The main goal is therefore to be able to predict, and if necessary increase, the true strength capacity without demolishing the roof structure. The past The first step is to identify the size of the problem. A multi-criteria analysis was already performed by the municipality and translated into a potential map. However the criterion “year of construction” has a high level of uncertainty because there is a lack of knowledge about older timber roof structures. The map distinguished five groups with different ranges of construction years which was based on experience. A logical step is an archival research to the history and typologies of houses in Rotterdam. This investigation revealed that most houses were built before 1940 (pre-war) but a large amount of roof structures are renovated or renewed in the 80’s. Timber was the main building material for roof structures but after World War II the focus was on speed and efficiency which resulted into more concrete roofs. Another consequence of World War II was the destruction of the city archive. This resulted into the loss of information about the present timber properties and dimensions. The structural geometry of flat roofs did not change over the years. During archival and literature research it was found that a beam supported by two masonry walls is standard practice. The main consequence of a green roof is than an increase of the bending moment of the existing timber elements. This increase may lead to collapse of the roof structure. Before extensive research towards the true strength of timber elements was performed, a more general investigation to gaining strength and possible weak spots was done. The idea was that some design norms throughout the years might have used too conservative values and thus strength could be gained by recalculating the structure with the current regulations. It was found that the values for roof structures stayed practically the same in the building codes. However most structures also satisfy the deflection requirement but this is not legally established. Beams that are designed on this requirement have extra strength. The visual grading norms, which determines the strength of a timber element based on visual characteristic, have become more flexible over the years. Also the strength classes changed, before 1933 no strength value was used but dimensions were based on experience. Afterwards two main strength classes were defined as standard building wood and construction wood which are more or less equal to C18 and C24 in modern times. Wood is an organic material which is sensitive to time dependent processes that reduce the strength. Age is not necessarily a strength-reducing factor but is associated with strength-reducing processes. Four degradation mechanisms can be distinguished for timber: mechanical, physical, chemical and biological. The latter is the largest problem for roofs because insulation or treating the wood was not always done (correctly). Table 2-5 gives an overview of positive and negative aspects for roof structures. The present Current approaches are based on identifying the state of the structure and calculating the extra load according to the active regulations for new buildings. The building code refers to the NEN8700 for coping with existing structures. This norm gives five solutions when the strength is not sufficient: reduce the reference period, values are based on actual use, adjust the use, adjust the safety margin or adjust the strength. This thesis focused on the first and last option. Reducing the reference period is discussed and not recommended unless the engineer can determine and control the load with high precision. It is not legally determined if the change of the safety level is allowed. This will lead to discussions with “construction and housing inspection” in the future because roofs are less safe. The extra capacity must thus be found in adjusting the strength. The idea is as follows, freshly sawn structural timber is graded into a strength class. This means that a small amount of the graded timber does not have to meet a certain limit strength. Nowadays the 5% lower probability value is chosen as the limit value. This way of strength grading allows for beams to be stronger than the characteristic value. The experiments were aiming to predict the actual strength without demolishing the roof. During the research, thirteen beams were obtained from an ongoing demolishment. Ten of these members are of a renovated roof structure from 1983 while the original structure was from 1923. The other three members are from another building where the original structure of 1923 was still present. A strength prediction model was used that required the density and dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE). The density can be measured with aid of a resistograph. Here it is important to drill in radial direction. Next a vibration meter was used to measure the wave speed which can be combined with the density to gain the dynamic MOE. Five sub-experiments were conducted to determine the difference between in-situ situations and free vibrations. As it turns out, a screw is the best way to introduce the wave and the surrounding increase the wave speed. This needs to be corrected with a certain coefficient on the frequency. A 6 to 10 percent increase of the frequency was found during testing. At last the true bending strength was checked with a four point bending test. The true strength was 20 to 140 percent higher than the characteristic value of the initial grade. Four strategies for future assessments are proposed: calculate as new structure according the current regulations, reduce the reference period (not recommended), visual upgrading and non-destructive tests. Each step requires more work but will, most likely, lead to extra strength. Two case studies were worked out following the different strategies. As expected, non-destructive tests is the most beneficial strategy because information about the actual strength is attained. With this information the strength class could be upgraded. In this case study it becomes clear that low weight green roofs (1 kN/m²) can be applied while a heavy green roof (3,4 kN/m²) needs more attention. A solution between these two extreme is also possible. Furthermore in one case the characteristic bending strength was increased with a factor of 1,5. Time dependent factors seem to be the main problem in all strategies. The duration of load may cause excessive deflections or even creep rupture. Limits to the deflections are not legally established and can be concealed with a lowered ceiling. The future The choice for a method of reinforcing an existing structure depends on a number of criteria. An engineer and user should discuss the possibilities that satisfies both. The most optimal solution will depend on the existing timber structure because every situation is unique. For the case studies the best solution is to increase the cross section of specific individual beams with timber elements. This method is easy, fast and cheap. At last an action plan was made for future assessments. Following the different steps in this protocol can make reinforcement and extra costs unnecessary and is thus the first step towards a Rotterdam with only green roofs.",0,article,True,https://openalex.org/W2221304946,https://openalex.org/W2221304946,"Tasks: geometry, strength, deterioration"
Influence of the relative rib area on bond behaviour,Giovanni Metelli; Giovanni Plizzari,2014,10.1680/macr.13.00198,Magazine of Concrete Research,"Steel-to-concrete bond is a basic aspect of the behaviour of reinforced concrete structures both at serviceability and ultimate states. When bond rules were originally developed, experimental results were mainly obtained on normal-strength concrete and a minimum relative rib area (bond index) was required by building codes to ensure good bond properties. The arrival into the market of high-performance concrete and newer structural needs may require different bond indexes. In the present paper, the experimental results of pull-out tests on short anchorages are presented. Several pull-out tests on ribbed bars, embedded in cubes of normal- and high-strength concrete with a concrete cover of 4·5 times the bar diameter, were carried out in order to better understand the influence of the relative rib area and bar diameter on the local bond behaviour, as well as on the splitting crack width generated by the wedging action of ribs. A total of 96 tests were performed on machined bars of three different diameters (12, 16 and 20 mm) with a bond index ranging from 0·040 to 0·105. The results of 55 pull-out tests on commercial hot-rolled ribbed bars of four different diameters (12, 20, 40 and 50 mm) are also presented to confirm that the bond response also depends on bar diameter (size effect). Experimental results provide information concerning the influence of the relative rib area on bond strength and on the bursting force due to the rib's wedge action. As the minimum measured bond strength of rebars was always markedly greater than the minimum bond strength required by building codes even when low bond indexes were adopted, the test results point out the possibility of reducing the minimum value of the relative rib area required by Eurocode 2 without limiting the safety coefficient of bond. The reduction also allows a higher structural ductility that can be achieved due to a greater strain penetration of the rebars from concrete cracks.",138,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1680/macr.13.00198,https://openalex.org/W2041638742,Tasks: geometry
Online monitoring of cracking in concrete structures using embedded piezoelectric transducers,Cédric Dumoulin; G.

Current economic requirements impose the reduction of the operating costs related to such inspection while the security and the reliability of structures must constantly be improved. In this paper, nondestructive testing is applied using piezoelectric transducers embedded in concrete structures. These transducers are especially adapted for online ultrasonic monitoring, due to their low cost, small size, and broad frequency band. These recent transducers are called smart aggregates. The technique of health monitoring developed in this study is based on a ultrasonic pulse velocity test with an embedded ultrasonic emitter-receiver pair (pitch-catch). The damage indicator focuses on the early wave arrival. The Belgian company MS3 takes an interest in evaluating the quality of the concrete around the anchorage system of highway security barriers after important shocks. The failure mechanism can be viewed as a combination of a bending and the failure of the anchorages. Accordingly, the monitoring technique has been applied both on a three-points bending test and several pull-out tests. The results indicate a very high sensitivity of the method, which is able to detect the crack initiation phase and follow the crack propagation over the entire duration of the test.",74,article,True,https://doi.org/10.1088/0964-1726/23/11/115016,https://openalex.org/W2006312659,Tasks: defects
Destructive and Non-destructive Testing of Concrete Structures,Malek Jedidi; Machta Kaouther,2014,,Jordan Journal of Civil Engineering,"The estimation of mechanical properties of concrete can be carried out by several methods; destructive and non-destructive. In this context, the crushing of the samples is the usual destructive test to determine the concrete strength. The rebound hammer test and the ultrasonic device are used in the field of non-destructive tests to determine respectively the compression strength and the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) in the concrete. In this work, eight concrete compositions were used to prepare cylindrical specimens (16 cm x 32 cm) by varying the water/ cement ratio and the cement dosage. An experimental study was conducted to determine the compressive strength of concrete by destructive (compression) and non-destructive (rebound hammer) tests at different ages (7, 14 and 28 days). In addition, the influence of several factors on the modulus of elasticity determined by pulse velocity test was investigated. These factors mainly included the age of concrete and the water/ cement ratio. The results showed that the difference between the resistance values obtained by destructive and non-destructive methods decreases with increasing age of concrete. The dynamic modulus of elasticity increases with the curing time of the concrete until the age of three months. In addition, a simplified expression has been proposed to estimate the rebound number from the value of the dynamic modulus of elasticity determined by pulse velocity test.",70,article,False,https://openalex.org/W1718224595,https://openalex.org/W1718224595,Tasks: strength

Nevertheless, the Normand tower still stands because it is located on a stable and stiffer foundation ground. The tower was built in the XII century. It is 20 m tall and has a symmetric square plan, with dimensions 11 m x 11 m; it was built for defense against enemy attacks. Inside the tower a cistern in reinforced concrete was placed in 1949. It is not connected to the structural walls of the tower; however it represents an obstacle for installing the damage detection equipment and sensors.

Determination of the distribution of electrical resistivity in reinforced concrete structures using electrical resistivity tomography,Kenji Reichling; Michael Raupach; Norbert Klitzsch,2014,10.1002/maco.201407763,Materials and Corrosion,"Concrete resistivity is an important durability related material parameter. It correlates with various properties, e.g., the reinforcement corrosion rate, the water saturation degree and the porosity. The resistivity is typically determined on a structure by using the Wenner probe. Unfortunately the results can strongly be influenced by heterogeneities, e.g., reinforcement bars or inhomogeneous moisture distributions. Neglecting these effects can lead to significant misinterpretations. In order to consider these influences quantitatively the applicability of the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) on reinforced concrete has been studied. The aim of the method is to determine the distribution of the concrete resistivity perpendicular to the concrete surface. Based on this data the spatial distribution of material properties can be derived and the influence of an inhomogeneous resistivity distribution on the corrosion rate of the reinforcement can be studied. ERT can be applied to determine the resistivity distribution of reinforced concrete within certain resolution limits. Within this work the influence of different electrode configurations and rebar positions as well as the improvement of the resolution by considering prior information are exemplarily shown.

Review of the Rebound Hammer Method Estimating Concrete Compressive Strength on Site,,2014,10.17758/ur.u1214338,,"Compressive strength of concrete is the most import ant input data for engineering calculations during the design of reinforced concrete structures. Compressive strength of concrete can be determined by testing of moulded specimens or by core specimens drilled from existing structures. Moulded specimens, however, do not always represent the actual condition of structural concrete and drilling of core specimens from certain structural members is not always possible (because of risk of the loss of structural stability or bad accessibility of the structural element to be examined). With non-destructive testing (NDT) devices the measurements can be performed directly on the structural concrete and the strength of concrete can be estimated from the measured results with limited reliability. One of these methods is a classic NDT method based on the surface hardness testing of concrete which became popular in the construction industry during the 1950's. Surface hardness testing is a long established NDT method for the strength estimation of materials. Nowadays, the Schmidt rebound hammer is still the surface hardness testing device of the most widespread use for concrete. Rebound hammer can be used very easily and the measure of hardness (i.e. the rebound index) can be read directly on the display of the testing device.

Experimental modal analysis of a precast, prestressed concrete roof comprised of modular double-tee joists was performed following exposure to an accidental fire. Empirical evidence of localized structural degradation is identified in the mode shapes, which suggests that modal parameters are sensitive to fire-induced damage in prestressed concrete members. Additionally, measured out-of-plane global modes are correlated with finite element simulations using a model of the as-built roof as well as a model updated using a large set of impact-echo measurements across the double-tee roof to spatially map localized reductions in stiffness. The comparisons support the experimental conclusions and further demonstrate that, by coupling nondestructive techniques, it is possible to construct a validated analytical model of structural components with sufficient fidelity to assess suitability for rehabilitation and reuse.

Time domain signals from air‐coupled impact‐echo (IE) tests are transformed into the frequency domain and arranged along x and y coordinates of the tested surface to give a 3‐D data set volume. Spectral amplitude is indicated by gray scale, giving rise to a “fourth” dimension of information within the data volume. This presentation, which stacks data in both spatial and spectral domains, includes all spectral data up to a natural frequency threshold (5–6 kHz) to isolate the response generated by near‐surface delamination defects. Visual interpretation of the dense data set of spectral information within the volume is enabled by incorporating transparency/opacity control on the data set, where higher spectral amplitudes are associated with more opacity. Consistent rule‐based criteria for optimal image parameter determination for a given test structure are established to optimize application for defect detection.

"Damage identification, progression, and condition rating of bridge decks using multi-modal non-destructive testing",Brian M. Pailes,2014,10.7282/t34m92v0,,"Bridges are an important part of the nation’s infrastructure and due to the limited budgets available to keep them properly maintained, the methods of evaluation and damage identification must improve in accuracy and cost-effectiveness. For the industry of bridge evaluation and damage identification the research area that provides the greatest potential is multi-modal non-destructive testing (NDT). A multi-modal NDT approach to condition assessment allows for the identification of several different deterioration states, in turn providing a more complete condition assessment. Research was conducted to develop a methodology and program to convert multi-modal NDT data from bare reinforced concrete bridge decks into a condition-based assessment. The NDT methods utilized were electrical resistivity (ER), half-cell potential (HCP), ground penetrating radar (GPR), impact echo (IE), and chain drag (CD). Data for each of these methods was collected on 12 bridge decks located in various geographic locations. Correlations were identified between the NDT methods so as to better understand the relationship between the methods and concrete deterioration. Some of the identified correlations include a strong association of low cover depth with deterioration, ER and HCP measurements being highly related, and GPR attenuation associated with locations of deterioration identify by ER, HCP, and CD. The identified correlations were used to develop a statistics-based approach to threshold identification for ER, HCP, and GPR. Threshold values are highly relative; therefore, a statistical approach provides a more effective and robust threshold identification methodology. Using the identified thresholds, the multi-modal NDT data was fused and converted into a deterioration-based condition assessment that identifies locations of corrosive environment, active corrosion, delamination/lateral cracking, and severe delamination. The condition assessment program also rates the bridge decks using established and federally mandated rating systems created by the National Bridge Inventory and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. This research resulted in a more effective multi-modal NDT condition assessment of bridge decks. Improved multi-modal NDT will provide bridge owners and maintenance personnel an improved tool to assess bridge decks and to make decisions regarding their maintenance.",7,article,True,https://doi.org/10.7282/t34m92v0,https://openalex.org/W2305055600,Tasks: geometry

Electrochemical half-cell potential measurements for the detection of reinforcement corrosion,Andreas Bürkert; Gino Ebell; Thorsten Eichler; Karim Hariri; Jörg Harnisch,2014,,,"This specification describes the application of electrochemical half‐cell potential measurements (frequently also called potential mapping) for the detection of reinforcement corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. Areas of corroding reinforcement steel can be located in a nondestructive manner by means of this procedure. Half‐cell potential measurements are used in order to detect chloride‐induced corrosion. However, it is not recommended in order to assess the risk of carbonation‐induced corrosion. For this purpose the determination of the carbonation depth and the concrete cover appear to be more appropriate.

The nondestructive and laboratory testing findings were used in determination of extent of fire damage to concrete and potential effects on the prestressing tendons. The in-situ nondestructive testing phase consisted of scanning affected areas using ultrasonic pulse velocity through concrete members and use of impact echo on a confirmatory limited basis. Subsequently, cores were removed and tested for resonant frequency-based dynamic modulus in accordance with ASTM C 215. Upon determination of dynamic elastic modulus of the entire core per ASTM C 215, the cores were sawn into 25-mm (1-in.) disks. Young's modulus of individual disks was determined by utilizing nondestructive measurement of resonant frequency. Determination of Young's modulus at small depth increments permitted assessment of the heat-induced damage gradient into the concrete and more importantly at the level of the prestressing tendons. The data from multiple techniques provided a means of comparison between constrained in-situ ASTM C 597 pulse velocity to unconstrained compression wave velocity obtained from ASTM C 1383, and an estimated unconstrained compression wave velocity based on dynamic modulus based on disks.

Of particular interest are surface opening cracks that extend through the concrete cover, as this can expose the steel reinforcement bars underneath and induce corrosion in them. This corrosion can lead to significant subsequent damage in concrete such as cracking and delamination of the cover concrete as well as rust staining on the surface of concrete. Concrete beams are designed and constructed in such a way to provide crack depths up to around 13 cm. Two different types of measurements are made in-situ to estimate depths of real surface cracks (as opposed to saw-cut notches) after unloading: one based on the impact-echo method and the other one based on the diffuse ultrasonic method. These measurements are compared to the crack depth visually observed on the sides of the beams.

Validation of Strengths and Limitations of Seismic Methods in Quality Management and Assessment of Shotcrete Liners,Hoda Azari; Soheil Nazarian; Deren Yuan,2014,10.1061/(asce)cf.1943-5509.0000523,Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities,"Shotcrete liners are being utilized more frequently in transportation infrastructure as retaining structures and tunnel covers. Despite their economic advantages to concrete, the initial quality of construction and long-term durability of shotcrete liners are of concern among highway agencies. The quantitative construction quality management is needed to ensure adequacy and uniformity of strength and thickness. Also, periodic inspection of shotcrete liners is necessary to assess possible material deterioration and to detect the onset of defects. The impact echo and ultrasonic surface wave methods are two nondestructive sonic methods that have been proven effective for those purposes in concrete structures. Unlike concrete slabs, shotcrete slabs exhibit spatial heterogeneity. In addition to heterogeneity, surface roughness of shotcrete adds some complications into data interpretation in terms of thickness measurement. The practical effectiveness of applying these methods to shotcrete liners using a commercially-available nondestructive testing device was evaluated in three actual tunnels. This paper focuses on validating the effectiveness of these methods through a well-controlled testing on a number of shotcrete specimens constructed with and without known defects. Results from this study demonstrate that the stiffness of shotcrete layer and the presence of delamination and voids within the shotcrete liners can be detected well by using these seismic methods in combination.",2,article,False,https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)cf.1943-5509.0000523,https://openalex.org/W2048722633,Tasks: geometry
Investigation of Inadequate Concrete Covers in a New Bridge Deck Using Ground Penetrating Radar,Istiaque Hasan; Nur Yazdani,2014,,Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"The reinforced concrete cast in place deck of the SH114/SH170 Bridge near Roanoke, Texas, was recently completed. The bridge deck is 183 m (600 ft.) long and 12.2 m (40 ft.) wide with four spans. Due to possible construction errors, it was suspected that the concrete cover in the deck did not conform to drawings and specifications approved by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). So, a full scale non-destructive evaluation of the concrete covers in the deck surface was carried out using a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) equipment. A 2.6 GHz frequency ground coupled antenna was used with the GPR for increased data acquisition accuracy within the top portions of the deck. A total of 19 exploratory locations on the deck were identified using the GPR and were drilled to determine the actual clear covers. These results were used to calibrate the GPR readings for the concrete dielectric constant. Taking advantage of the rapid data collection ability of the GPR, the bridge deck was scanned and concrete cover values were determined from the radargram generated from the scan. The estimated covers were plotted on contour maps for each deck span, showing cover value distributions across the bridge deck. The results show that around 48% of the deck areas had inadequate concrete covers below the specified American Association of State highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) minimum value of 64 mm (2.5 in.). Moreover, some locations on the deck have excess clear cover ranging from 75 mm – 100 mm (3 in. to 4 in.). Based on the results, significant retrofitting of the bridge deck, such as additional overlay, is recommended before opening it to the traffic.",1,article,False,https://openalex.org/W649094640,https://openalex.org/W649094640,Tasks: geometry
Determination of the Corrosion Probability in Reinforced Concrete Structures by Design in Situ Monitoring System,Guillermo Roa Rodríguez; W. Aperador; E. Delgado,2014,10.1149/ma2014-02/13/762,ECS Meeting Abstracts,"Introduction Corrosion of concrete rebar has been established as the main factor of the premature deterioration of reinforced concrete structures. The occurrence of such phenomena represents mostly the durability problems of the material, especially when the structure is subjected to the chloride ions presence (in marine or high salinity enviroment) and large amounts of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ), processes known as chloride penetration and carbonation respectively [1,2,3] . Once the corrosión process has appeared in rebar, these begin to generate large stresses on the layer of concrete around them (due to the iron oxides that accumulate around the transversal area) which over time can generate microcracks, cracks and failure on the general structure [4] . Given the importance of preserving civil structures, is evident the strong necessity of obtaining a system with great flexibility to perform the estimation in situ of the corrosive state, capable to dispose the information for immediate consultation anywhere with minimum internet access. Therefore, the present work shows the development and implementation of a system for in situ monitoring of corrosion, for any reinforced concrete structure based on ASTM C876-91 [5] standard for measuring half-cell potential, with which it is possible to determine the corrosion probability of rebar in reinforced concrete structures. Also, the equipment performance is presented by using different reference electrodes as Copper / Copper Sulfate ( Cu -CuSO 4 ), silver / silver chloride ( Ag / AgCl ) and Zinc / Zinc Sulfate ( Zn -ZnSO 4 ). Experiments and Results It was obtained a system for in situ monitoring of corrosion for reinforced concrete, that allows to estimate the corrosion probability on rebar, where the user send a text message, to start the test in the system and in return, via GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), the equipment disposes the data trend on a graphic trough a web server on an internet domain (figure 1). The system was tested on a building of the University complex, where its performance was evaluated using three different reference electrodes, obtaining an error over the measurement, between the standard and the system, of 6.62% (figure 2).

Non-Destructive Testing Techniques for Corrosion Assessment in Reinforced Concrete Structures in Kenya,Violah J. Salbei; Cox M. W. Sitters; J. Vantomme,2014,,Civil and environmental research,"Deterioration of concrete structures is inevitable due to the fact that it is subjected to deterring environmental factors. Therefore, inspection and maintenance of these structures should be done to ensure their serviceability. Many concrete structures have been constructed in Kenya. A survey of some of the existing multi-storey buildings shows that even some of the old ones are in good condition; examples are the Norfork Hotel, Sarova Stanley Hotel and the railway bridges built in early 1900s. Yet, ageing structures require periodic monitoring to check their serviceability. Currently, inspection of most structures is done solely by simple visual means which is not always adequate. In order to enhance reliable assessment of structures, the present research introduces non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques for corrosion damage diagnosis in Kenyan concrete structures. Visual inspection is followed by half-cell potential measurements, carbonation tests and chloride tests. Laboratory analysis as well as field testing shows that NDT techniques provide safe, fast and reliable tools for the assessment of structural integrity.

Among those new models, the use of data from Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) is recommended. It is known that electrical resistivity is a parameter related with permeability and, in consequence, with the resistance of the concrete against the intrusion of aggressive agents. Electrical resistivity may be monitored with time by a NDT method, by a low cost and easy execution technique. However, some parameters of this essay need to be further discussed in the literature aiming to standardize this technique. Thus, this study had the goal to verify the influence of test specimen’s shape in measurements of electrical resistivity. In order to that, cylindrical and prismatic test specimens have been molded from a same type of concrete and electrical resistivity was monitored during a period of 120 days. Results show significant differences between the values obtained. Test specimens in cylindrical shape had the higher results.

During a field survey, it was identified that the posttensioned beams exhibited visually apparent deflections. An engineering evaluation was initiated to identify the cause of this type of cracking in the posttensioned structural system. Following a field survey and document review, an analysis was initiated for the estimation of potential posttension losses and analytical expected deflections for the purposes of comparing it to measured deflections in the field. After the analytical phase, an in situ, nondestructive evaluation phase and a subsequent material testing phase were initiated. The in situ evaluation of the structure involved nondestructive testing of concrete slabs and beams using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to locate tendons. Cores were removed, and compressive strength testing and petrographic analysis of the cores were performed in the laboratory.

COMPARING EXPERIMENTAL AND SIMULATED GPR AMPLITUDES FROM REBAR IN HEALTHY AND CORRODED REINFORCED CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS,Nicole Martino; Ralf Birken; Ken Maser,2014,10.4133/sageep.27-093,Symposium on the Application of Geophysics to Engineering and Environmental Problems 2014,"Combining Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Half-Cell Potential (HCP) methods has recently shown significant success in diagnosing the condition of reinforced concrete bridge decks. More specifically, the electromagnetic signal amplitudes extracted from the upper rebar layer of a corroded area are strongly associated with low electrochemical potentials, and vice versa for healthy areas. The majority of these investigations have been experimental, taking place in either a controlled laboratory setting, or in the field. The reported research seeks to confirm these results using electromagnetic properties measured on actual decks as input to theoretical models which simulate the deck electromagnetic response. Since previous research has shown that chloride, compared to cracking and rust, is the major contributor to electromagnetic signal attenuation at the rebar level in corroded areas, this research focuses solely on modeling the chloride content of concrete. Concrete powder samples were extracted from bridge decks with various corrosion levels, where known radar amplitudes and half-cell potentials were available. The chloride content of the concrete powder was determined using QuanTab® titrator strips. Electromagnetic properties, like the complex permittivity, were computed using the Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM), the chloride content data and typical moisture contents found in literature. These data were then computationally modeled using a finite difference time domain modeling tool customized for civil engineering applications. Simulations were carried out on a full scale section of a bridge deck contaminated with the computed electromagnetic properties. The simulated signal attenuation was then compared to actual radar data collected in the same area.

The objectives of this project were to explore the relationship between the capabilities of ultrasonic testing (UT) and phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) and the requirements for flaw detection and characterization. This research assessed the variables that impact UT measurements to improve the methodology used to inspect steel welds in structural components. This research explored the variables that influence the ultrasonic response to improve which include: length measurement, beam spread, attenuation, defect orientation, transducer rotation, wedge angle and defect sizing. The results from these tests were then compared to the American Welding Society (AWS) UT procedure used to inspect structural components in steel bridges. The findings from the length measurement test indicated that defects smaller than the transducer were typically oversized. The results from the defect orientation and wedge angle tests indicated that the defect�s orientation and the wedge angle greatly affected the reflected amplitude. The results from the attenuation tests indicated that the assumptions made in AWS acceptance criteria were inaccurate. The results from this research will then be used in the development of PAUT.

Infrared Thermography as an Alternative Method for the Assessment of Moisture Content Readings in a Porous Brick,Sarah Catherine Cole,2014,,ScholarlyCommons (University of Pennsylvania),"Many pre- to late-nineteenth century brick masonry structures encountered by conservation professionals are constructed with hygroscopic, porous brick that has been attacked by the combination of moisture and salt. The presence of these enabling factors of deterioration accelerates damage to a brick. Professionals need an affordable nondestructive tool that does not require extensive calibrations to highlight dangerous levels of moisture in the presence of soluble salts at a macroscopic scale prior to evident material loss. The infrared camera has been proven to display a visual image of moisture anomalies in a brick wall, but quantification requires spot readings with a moisture meter and accurate quantification requires sampling and laboratory testing. This paper investigates whether an infrared camera can be used to quantitatively determine in situ moisture content of a porous brick wall. In achieving this, a testing procedure was developed and performed on thirty-two hand-molded colonial face brick cuboid samples conditioned to four equilibrium moisture contents. The results of this test concluded that infrared thermography can distinguish different levels of moisture content with the thermal images. Secondly, there exists a linear relationship between ∆T surface center point and measured moisture content as well as a similar relationship between ∆T average surface and measured moisture content when room %RH is lower than equilibrium %RH for the sample. The linear relationship of measured moisture content and ∆T may be consulted for determining moisture content readings in different ambient conditions; however, nearly saturated samples require further study.",0,article,False,https://openalex.org/W64937217,https://openalex.org/W64937217,Tasks: moisture
